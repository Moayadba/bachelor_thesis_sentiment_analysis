It<U+0092>s very difficult to get a short squeeze with a large float, even if the short interest is high. With $OSAT, the total float is only 900,000.

Recent share price increase also opens up the option to raise more cash through equity offerings._x000D__x000D__x000D__x000D_\n* ACTIVIST INVESTOR RYAN COHEN - Activist investor Ryan Cohen is campaigning to focus the company on ecommerce instead of brick-and-mortar retail. Stocks tend to do well if a company is targetted by activist investors and Cohen is the perfect activist investor to drive change at GameStop given his experience running Chewy, an online retailer for pet products. Cohen and two former Chewy execs were recently appointed to GameStop's board._x000D__x000D__x000D__x000D_\n* LEVERAGE EXISTING ONLINE FOOTPRINT - GameStop can leverage its existing online footprint (GameStop.com and GameInformer.com) as a low cost starting point to grow its ecommerce business._x000D__x000D__x000D__x000D_\n* 5,000 BRICK-AND-MORTAR STORES FOR OMNICHANNEL RETAIL - GameStop's 5,000 brick-and-mortar stores is unintuitively an asset for its ecommerce pivot. Market research shows that omnichannel retail strategies perform better than purely-online strategies (e.g. Apple and its iconic Apple Stores). The real-life experience of physical stores increases customer spending and brand loyalty. GameStop's focus on gaming and its many physical stores give it an omnichannel edge over other gaming ecommerce retailers. For example, its stores can be optimized for gaming experiences while Walmart and Best Buy don't have room to be specific._x000D__x000D__x000D__x000D_\n* OPPORTUNITY TO CUT FAT - GameStop's stores have short term leases (24 months average lease duration) which gives it opportunities to cut fat by closing underperforming stores._x000D__x000D__x000D__x000D_\n* LARGE LOYALTY PROGRAM - GameStop's PowerUp loyalty program has 55 million members that are, or can be converted, to dedicated ecommerce customers._x000D__x000D__x000D__x000D_\n* LOW PRICE TO SALES RATIO - Even with a $2.5 billion market cap ($35.5 per share), GameStop has a relatively low price-to-sales (PS) ratio of 0.4. The SP500's median PS ratio is 1.5. Chewy, the company co-founded by Ryan Cohen, trades at over 6 times sales. Even with just a PS ratio of 1, GME's price would be around $90._x000D__x000D__x000D__x000D_\n* GAMING INDUSTRY GROWING RAPIDLY - The gaming industry has been growing rapidly over the last few years and GameStop is in a great position to capitalize on this growth if management can successfully pivot the company._x000D__x000D__x000D__x000D_\n* INVESTOR MINDSHARE - GME's explosive move last week caught everyone off guard and now everyone's talking/thinking about it (especially Jim Cramer). With so many people watching the stock, expect any modicum of good news to propel the stock upwards._x000D__x000D__x000D__x000D_\n* SHORT SQUEEZE - A short squeeze can happen when many short positions are forced to close at once when the short stock's price increases rapidly. This creates a temporary burst in buying pressure that can rapidly increase a stock's price in the short term. GME is a heavily shorted stock and is at high risk of short squeezes._x000D__x000D__x000D__x000D_\n_x000D__x000D__x000D__x000D_\n# Bear Case_x000D__x000D__x000D__x000D_\n_x000D__x000D__x000D__x000D_\n* FAILURE TO PIVOT - GameStop's biggest risk is a failure to pivot to an omnichannel ecommerce business. To reach this goal, the company has significant hurdles to clear. For one, there are many competitors in the gaming ecommerce space. Walmart, Amazon, and Best Buy compete with GameStop in selling physical gaming products like consoles and accessories. If GameStop starts to sell digital goods like downloadable games, it'll face intense competition from Steam, EA's Origin, and Microsoft's Xbox Game pass, as examples. To succeed in this hyper competitive space, GameStop needs to find a niche and grow from there. This is a difficult journey requiring business acumen, finesse, and dedication from its executive team._x000D__x000D__x000D__x000D_\n* UNFAVORABLE BROADER MARKET CONDITIONS - GME is a speculative stock and speculative stocks are the hardest-hit during a market downturn. Economic conditions remain uncertain with the slow rollout of the vaccines, the fact that we don't know how _practically_ effective the vaccines are, the apperance of multiple COVID-19 strains around the world, and the likely resumption of debt payments this year (e.g. end of the student loan moratorium in May and the end of the eviction moratorium in February). The chances of a market downturn in 2021 is non-trivial. In addition, even if the pandemic does end and North America and Europe opens up again, expect a short term decline in gaming interest as everyone rushes to go back outside. This can negatively impact GameStop's earnings for a couple of quarters._x000D__x000D__x000D__x000D_\n_x000D__x000D__x000D__x000D_\n# Trade Plan_x000D__x000D__x000D__x000D_\n_x000D__x000D__x000D__x000D_\nGME has been a red hot stock in the past few months and last week's giant push to almost $40 will be followed by a period of consolidation as bulls take profit and bears place shorts. During this time, the stock will trade sideways or downwards._x000D__x000D__x000D__x000D_\n_x000D__x000D__x000D__x000D_\nIf you're a GME bull and hold shares, consider selling out-of-the-money covered calls during the consolidation period.

During this time, any positive news is a strong price catalyst. I'm most interested in what changes will come from Ryan Cohen now that he has board representation. For example, it'll be very bullish if the current CEO, George Sherman, is replaced. Sherman is a brick-and-mortar retail veteran and not the best CEO to change GameStop into an ecommerce giant. I won't be surprised if Sherman stepping down is a similar event to Intel CEO Bob Swan's resignation announcement, which caused Intel's stock price to jump by more than 10%._x000D__x000D__x000D__x000D_\n_x000D__x000D__x000D__x000D_\n____x000D__x000D__x000D__x000D_\n_x000D__x000D__x000D__x000D_\nI write over at a small blog called [FinanceTLDR](https://www.financetldr.com/) but it's always great to share the research with fellow degens in /r/wsb.", "completion": "NEUTRAL"}
