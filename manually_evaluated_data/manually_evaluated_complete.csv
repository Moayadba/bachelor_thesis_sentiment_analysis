With or without Steve Jobs, the trajectory Jobs has set is pretty clear. The devices will only get thinner, faster, better screens and battery life.









Naturally the software side will also improve as we see the voice to text come to the iphone (yes, my android has had that function for a while already).









The longer term trend here is still intact, even if the stock had to hit $350 range next month, it is still within the uptrend.

46,5qhzcy,AAPL,"Well, this is it: Going All-in. My last stand. My final Yolo. $2M-5M possible payoff. (NASDAQ:AAPL): To all visitors from /r/all: Please read the explanation at the bottom if you don't understand what's




going on and need explanations on my trades, or what puts and calls are. Thank you.




Three and a half years ago, my favorite uncle died after a short battle with cancer. Up until the moment he




died, none of us even knew he was sick. Uncle Richard was a secretive man who lived a secretive life. He




didn""t like to discuss his personal matters. We saw him once or twice per year, at family gatherings,




where he usually stood alone in a corner, slowly drinking his brandy and seven-up.




I was one of the few people who took the time to go talk to him. Truth be told, I rather enjoyed his




presence. He was a tenacious listener and he had the gift of always making you feel appreciated. After his




wife died in her late 40s, I think he had some kind of breakdown, from which he never recovered. I know




that he truly loved her and the rest of his life was spent living alone in something he sometimes described




to me as an ""unending fog."" Our family invited him because, well, he was part of the family, and also




because he was generous with his bottles of homemade wine, perhaps his only passion in life, or at least




the only one that we knew of.




The day he passed away, I learned he was bequeathing me over 2.5 million dollars.




My uncle had never really had a career or a profession of any kind. He stuck to the usual odd jobs, being a




trucker here, working in security there, even teaching at some point, but he would usually never last long.




When he died, everyone was shocked at the fortune he had managed to amass. But my uncle was an




ascetic and austere man: he lived in the same, tiny house he had built by himself for $10,000 decades ago,




drove a car that was older than me and wore the same clothes quite possibly since his high school times,




year after year. He preferred to repair rather than rebuy and still had that giant, clumsy television from the




80s instead of that shiny new LCD. All in all, it""s crazy to think what an average man, living an average




life, can accumulate over 45 years of his life if he puts his will to the task.




He had no one to give his money to, I guess. No children, no wife and no friends that we knew of. I




remember I was driving back from some boring class at some boring community college when I got the




call. I was so <U+0093>estomaqu<e9><U+0094> (stomached?) I had to pull over on the highway, first of all because I had no




idea he had passed away or that he was even sick, second to ask the notary to repeat the amount he was 




53




All rights reserved <U+0096> www.FSComeau.com




reading to me. Up to that point, I myself had been drifting from a place to another, not unlike him, from a




formation in accounting that led me nowhere to some useless telemarketer job. The call, from his will




executor, changed my life completely.




With his legacy came one small letter, visibly scribbled quickly days before his death, if that, on a single




sheet of paper (loose translation):




<U+0093>Frank,




As a kid, I was told that life was a game. Now that I""m all grown up, I can tell you that life is indeed a




game; just not a very fun one.




R.<U+0094>




And that was it. A few months later, one or two court fights later (some family members tried to contest




the will, of course) and I was a rich man, my life forever changed. My first reaction was to want to place




half in an index fund and now that I look at it today, I can""t tell you how badly I wish I had done that. But




I didn""t and one of the biggest bad streak of my life would soon begin.




I wanted to trade. I had always wanted to trade and the world of daytrading seemed like a utopia to me. At




first, I had success. People might remember my big Apple bet a few years ago where I essentially made




$30,000 in under a week. Looking back at it today, much later, I regret winning that trade. Perhaps if I




had lost everything on that trade, it would have disgusted me from trading forever and I would still have




much of that $2.5M today. But I won, and I won for a good while, and it kept me going.




Then, I began to lose.




I lost $500,000 due to the oil crash in late 2014. I had a ton of Canadian stock (the TSX went down




something like 30% at some point) and many, many oil stocks. I made it all back in early 2015, then lost




it all again in the first six months of the year, plus another $500,000 for the rest of the year. I was




panicking, hardcore, as a million dollars is no small amount to lose, Canadian or American.




I lost $100,000 in one night to Brexit. Another $50,000 betting on Hillary. The summer of 2016




specifically was particularly cruel to me. People who were there will remember that I lost pretty much




every single time. I was tilting, because I knew I was making the right trades, yet losing time after time




after time. But I knew I had done it before and I knew, or at least thought, that I could do it again.




I lost on several failed investments, from a stupid fast-food restaurant I wanted to start (which I won""t




name) to an apartment building where I lost my shirt. I also lost a fortune at the casino, mostly on




blackjack (man, the swings I got) and certainly poker. At my worst, I lost $30,000 in a week playing




$5/$10 poker. I got absolutely horrific hands and I got so many bad beats I stopped counting them. Yeah.




54




All rights reserved <U+0096> www.FSComeau.com




So to make a short story, this brings us to today. From the original amount, I have $325,000 Canadian




left. I have a $100,000 personal loan at 8% (yeah), a $51,000 credit card debt accruing at 19% per year




and various debts ranging from 6 to 10%. Oh man I feel so dumb <U+0096> I could have paid the car I am driving




in cash, but somehow I ended up getting financing because<U+0085> Because.




If I liquidated all my positions and stopped trading today, yes, I could probably repay my debts. And then




what? I would have almost nothing left, nothing at all. My $2.5M would be gone forever and perhaps




most of my mental sanity along with it. What""s the point? Truth be told, at this point, I have really




nothing to lose. Worst case scenario, this yolo fails and I go bankrupt. If I'm going out, well, I'm going




out big. I'd rather take my chance to get my money back.




This is perhaps my last chance in life to <U+0093>hit it big,<U+0094> aka be someone. I won""t get another chance like this.




Look, I""ll be blunt: I want my two point five million back. It""s mine and I want it back, period. Unless




you""ve hit it big and lost it all, you don""t know how incredibly painful it is to look at $325,000 and think,




<U+0093>Yeah, this used to be 7 times higher.<U+0094>




And here comes the Yolo.




I began my career with Apple, I""m ending it with Apple. No matter what happens, this is going to be my




final Yolo. I""m sorry, I wish I could continue, but I""m tired of trading. It's morally and emotionally




exhausted and over the last two years, it's really taken a huge toll of my health, both mental and physical.




Some of you might have noticed the (subtle) changes in my personality and demeanors. It is time for me




to stop making a fool out of myself and stop suffering. I am tired of perpetually losing money. That




Google trade was the last straw. Even though I called the earnings perfectly, I still somehow lost money.




The stock market is rigged and I am done with it.




People who know me well know that I am an Apple expert. Without a doubt, Apple is my specialty. I




called the exact iPhones sales, revenues and estimates pretty much every quarter, and I can tell you Apple




is about to get a massive miss. Notice how there is no real <U+0093>hype<U+0094> around those earnings? That""s because




for the first time in, like, forever, Apple has failed majorly. They don""t want to foam around it because




they know very well it""s going to be catastrophic.




iPhone sales will be down 10-15% - and that will be the good part of their earnings report. iPads are




basically dead. The iPad pro is nothing more than a joke. It probably sold less than the Pixel. Okay, not




that bad, but trust me, iPad sales have been terrible for a while and this time, they""ll be so bad Apple




might actually throw in the towel. Truth be told, Apple is 2+ years late and 5+ years late in some sectors




when compared to the industry.




55




All rights reserved <U+0096> www.FSComeau.com




And apart from iPhone and iPads, What else does Apple has at this point? Mac sales are down, the iPod is




dead, the Apple Watch<U+0085> let""s not even mention the Apple Watch lol. What else does Apple have? iTunes




revenues? That""s like a billion dollars, who cares.




Look at recent tech earnings: Google, WDC, QCOM<U+0085> All freaking terrible! The entire sector is going




down and Apple, with its overpriced crap (it almost hurts me to write that) is at the forefront. An iPhone




is up to $ 1,400 here. I mean, like, what were they thinking?




I could go on and on explaining why Apple is going to crater after earnings. Basically, it almost always




does. Look at the past earnings: even when it did beat earnings estimates, it crashed afterwards. Apple is




just a very emotional stock and people like to mass sell it after earnings. And with how bad things are,




there is no chance in hell Apple will beat earnings.




Apple is not dead, but it""s going to slowly drift down into the abyss (See: Blackberry, Nokia, etc.). No




one can remain at the top forever and with so many companies producing phones, many of them far better




than the iPhone, it simply doesn""t stand a chance. I mean, the iPhone is like 65% of the profits. And this




brings me to my main points: the iPhone 7 is a fiasco. Worst, it is going against the VERY popular and




lucrative iPhone 6s (the <U+0093>S<U+0094> series always earns Apple more profits as the machines are already




calibrated) AND the strongest line of Android phones of all times.




Okay, name me ONE thing about the iPhone 7. Go! When you think iPhone 7, you think<U+0085>




<U+0085> no headphone jack. That""s it. The iPhone 7 has no headphone jack. I dare you to name me ONE thing




that is different with the iPhone 7 when compared to the 6s. Go. Without looking it up, even I couldn""t




find anything. And when your main selling point is a feature disappearing, it""s not good.




For the first time in like forever, it seems the iPhone had no hype at all. Perhaps everyone has one yet,




perhaps no one saw enough reason to upgrade (waiting for 7s?) or perhaps no one cared, but I can tell you




the iPhone 7 is an astounding failure. Oh, they sold tens of millions, but it""s plain and simply not enough.




Have you seen many people with an iPhone 7? Have you seen many people with an Apple Watch (which




has been turned into the subject of a mockery) Yeah, I thought so.




In simple words, Apple has lost it. It went from being a simple company with a simple product line to




some jammed messed. Everyone remembers the iPhone. There was ONE iPhone and one iPhone alone.




Now, there are something like 10 different iPhones available with so many options nobody knows what's




going on. iPhone 7, 6, 6 plus, 6s, 6s plus, Se... What the hell is that? And I'm not even speaking of the 20




different colors that make no sense. And just look at the Apple Watch and try to understand what's going




on: apple watch 2, apple watch Nike+, apple watch hermes, apple watch edition, apple watch 1...




Seriously what the heck is that thing?




56




All rights reserved <U+0096> www.FSComeau.com




Speaking of technology, Apple has fallen so far behind it's not funny anymore. The iPhone SE still comes




with 16GB!!! Sixteen GB!!!!! Is this some kind of joke? My operating system takes more than 16 GB!




How many minutes of video can you record with 16GB! Compare that to Android which often come with




SD cards and possibly terabytes of data and you've got a real joke on your hand. And almost every




Android phone outperforms the iPhone in every mark. The iPhone isn't even the top phone anywhere




anymore - it's gone, people!




All in all, we face the same problems we faced in 2012 when Apple""s stock crashed from $100 to $60:




dying business lines (iPod at the time) and no innovation at all. Apple was able to save face once, and




then again, not really: it underperformed the index from 2012 to today, only going up 20% in 5 years in a




period where the S&amp;P500 basically doubled. Tomorrow""s dreadful earnings will mark the end of Apple as




an innovative company as we know it. It will now be priced as a commodity company and this implies a




much, much lower valuation.




Google is still able to grow. Microsoft is still about to grow. Apple is about to report a sharp drop in




earnings, around 15-20% and perhaps as large as 25%, if they are honest (they can still fudge the number




somewhat). With much lower iPhone sales, it""s simply not possible for them to beat the very inflated




earnings estimates. This sharp drop in earnings, coupled with a terrible guidance for the rest of 2017




(strong USD, world tensions due to Trump, Apple failing in China <U+0096> all points I don""t have time to cover,




but which are very valid) will lead to Apple getting one of the biggest hits in the history of hits.




I""ll be blunt: Apple will drop 8-10% in afterhours (maybe more), it will open down 15% the next day and




end the day down more 20%. Yes, that""s how bad it is. And I""ll be there to earn a fortune from it. As I




said, I want my millions back.




My #Yolo is designed in a very specific way. It""s designed so that even if I am wrong (which I am not), I




will not lose money. Yep, it's that good. Before I try to explain it to you, let me explain this: I am 99.9%




certain AAPL is going to plummet post-earnings, but as there always is no way for me to know for sure.




There is so much market manipulation some banks might keep it from falling more than 2-3% just to be




able to liquidate their calls at the opening bell, etc. For this reason, I chose longer- expiration options as




Apple will most likely keep dropping in the days to follow (as more and more people realize Apple is the




next Blackberry and start selling their fund. People can""t liquidate a $2-3B position overnight). Thus, I




chose the monthly, February 17th expiration. Big manipulators might be able to manipulate the price




somewhat, but not very long.




57

I also made my trade voluntarily more complex to account for all possible scenarios (more on that later). I




have been screwed by big funds before and I have designed this trade so that even if I get screwed, I




won""t lose money.




So, without further ado, here is my yolo:




1) I bought $120 puts, twice the amount of $115 puts, 4 times the amount of $110 puts, 8 times the




amount of $105 puts and 16 times of $100 puts. Those are unbelievably cheap ATM. TOTAL COST:




$100,000 USD.




2) To cover the premium paid for those puts, I sold a massive amount of $120 calls. I used the entire




premium to buy the puts (and the calls below).




3) To be allowed to make that trade (margin requirement is crazy on naked calls), I bought a ton of $128




calls. This is a vertical spread which allows me to do the trade as I want it. Of course, there is no chance




AAPL is $128 after earnings, but without those calls, I would need a $2M+ cushion in margin, which I




don""t have (anymore). TOTAL CREDIT: $100,000 USD.




4) All in all, this trade has cost me nothing to do :D. That""s right: $0 upfront cost! Free!




5) To get the margin required for this trade, I had to sell all my long-term stocks and ALL my other plays.




Some of the margin is also taken from my Credit card but at this point, it doesn""t make a difference.




A 100K YOLO FOR 100K WSB SUBSCRIBERS! If you want to have fun, draw the payout that comes




from this strategy.




So, what will happen on earnings? Well, simply said: IT IS SIMPLY NOT POSSIBLE FOR APPLE TO




SPIKE UP POST-EARNINGS. It didn""t happen to Google, it didn""t happen to Western Digital,




Qualcomm or even Intel or Microsoft (2%! Yay!), despite excellent earnings (which Apple won""t have). 




58

Based on that, here are all the possible scenarios that could happen, ranked from worst to best, along with




what would happen to me:




1) The Google Gambit: Big funds play the <U+0093>oh they had one below average quarter but they are still




growing and they have huge product lines coming (yeah, right)<U+0094> <U+0096> stock miraculously only drops 1-2%




(like GOOG) is - I don""t make any money, but I don""t lose any either. I""m pissed off. Likelihood:&lt; 1%




2) The Qualcomm Quack: Apple somehow miraculously saves face by playing with




inventories/supplies/doing Valeant stuff. Then, the stock would drop only 3-4%. I would make a little bit




of money. Likelihood: 4%




3) The <U+0093>we barely got away with that one<U+0094> scenario: Apple cheats and starts buying its own iPhones to




prevent the number from crumbling too bad. It""s a bad quarter, but not too bad. Apple crashes to $118 in




AH and then drifts down to $115. I essentially double my money, a $100,000 gain. Likelihood: 20%




4) The <U+0093>last minute wildcard<U+0094> scenario: Apple somehow managed to earn more than I thought on some




miracle play (hedging). Earnings are down by quite a bit. Apple crashes to $115 and barely stays above




$110 in the next few trading sessions. I essentially quadruple my money, a $300,000 gain. Likelihood:




25%




5) The <U+0093>Back in the Basement<U+0094> Scenario: Apple is honest about its terrible quarter and results, but




downplays it and people somehow buy it. Apple crashes to $112 in AH and drifts down to $105 by Feb




17. I essentially sixtuple my money. A $500,000 gain. Likelihood:15%




6) The Meltdown Scenario Apple: is honest about its terrible quarter and investors aren""t dumb. They




mass sell the stock. It crumbles to $105 in AH and some idiots buy it thinking it""s a <U+0093>bargain.<U+0094> I make




over a million overnight and another $250,000 in the days that follow. It crashes to $95 by Feb 17.




*Likelihood: 25% *




7) The <U+0093>Hillary Clinton Scenario<U+0094>: It""s worse than I thought. Tim Cook apologizes and steps down, citing




personal problems. Apple plummets below $100 in AH. People panic, everyone wants to sell, it""s on the




top of every newspapers. It opens at $101 the next day, immediately gaps below $97 and then spiral down




to $90 where it belongs (maybe even lower, but let""s keep it at that). I more than fiftytuple my money,




making $5,000,000. *Likelihood: 10% *




So, what is the expected expectancy of that trade? it""s 1% * $0 + 4% * $15,000 + 20% * $100,000 + 25%




* $300,000 +15% * $500,000 + 25% * $1,150,000 + 10% *$5,000,000= $958,100.




Here""s a graph with possible payouts. The top column shows the price of apple, the leftmost row the gain




for each put (remember, $0 initial cost <U+0096> costs are covered):

Understand this: Apple WILL drop post-earnings. There is absolutely no way whatsoever it can go up. It




can""t happen. I mean, Google is down by quite a bit after its earnings, the entire tech sector is down, but




AAPL somehow stays at $122. Okay. I am hoping for a massive, massive, MASSIVE drop obviously. I




wouldn""t be satisfied with Apple dropping to $115, for example.




I expect to make close to a million from that trade, although there is a lot of possible variance. Obviously,




I wouldn""t be happy with the $100,000 scenario as this is my chance, and probably my last chance, to get




my money back. Note that even if apple doesn""t go below $100, my $100 strike puts will gain in value if




Apple drops to $109 post-earnings, so I might make a bit more there.




I want to thank everyone on /r/wsb for the continued and unending support. You have truly helped me get




to where I am and I just want to say that no matter what happens, I""ll have no regret. You have




entertained me during dark times in my life and quite possibly saved me. You guys never failed to make




me laugh with your puns, memes and other and for this, I especially thank you <U+0096> especially those who




were generous enough to become my patrons or get me reddit gold.




One final thing. I don""t know if God exists. I won""t pretend that I suddenly believe in Him (or Her), like




so many do in their time of need, but if you do exist God: please, please, please, please, please help me. I




have never been lucky in this life and you have thrown many obstacles in my way, but if you help me




here, everything is forgiven. It""s not that hard to break that $100 floor and once that happens, it""s game




over <U+0096> I""m rich. I know the earnings are going to suck. Don""t let big banks screw me once again.




If I do win, here is my promise:




1) I WILL repay all my debts, in full, immediately.




2) I WILL place half the money in a long-term fund that pays 4-5% per year. Banks, Telecoms, Pipelines,




etc.




3) I WILL use a quarter of the money to buy a house and plenty of nice things.




4) I WILL use the last quarter of the money to travel the world, enjoying life.




5) I SWEAR ON EVERYTHING THAT I AM AND EVERYTHING THAT I HAVE THAT I WILL




NEVER, EVER, EVER TRADE AGAIN.




In therapy, I was told that the most important thing was being honest with yourself. I""ll be honest with




yourself and also myself: I""m not a good trader. I""m so tired of losing. I wasted two years of my life on 




60




All rights reserved <U+0096> www.FSComeau.com




this bullshit. No matter what happens, this is my last trade. After that, I am moving on and never, ever




even thinking about finance or stock ever again. Two years of perpetually losing money are enough for




me. But recently, I have been on a hot streak (100% success recently) and I just need the streak to last




one. last. time.




Verdict: Massively short AAPL through earnings.




AS LONG AS APPLE DOESN""T GO UP, I DO NOT LOSE MONEY. GLTA.




QUICK UPDATE 1/27/2017 2:56PM




UPDATE Original post forgot to mention all WSBers will receive a free can of maple syrup OR a pack of




maple sugar if I make at least $1,000,000 from this trade. Yes, this is for real. I called in for a quote and it




will cost me $65k-$85k to ship it all at a discount, assuming all US and CAN addresses. Other shippers




might be cheaper, I guess I'll see. DISCLAIMER: Limited to the first 10,000 posters, reserved to people




who made at least one post/comment on /r/wallstreetbets before today. Mods get priority. Check my




Youtube video on it for details.




Quick update for those who asked (damn you, reddit formatting system! I'd short you if you had earnings




coming!) http://i.imgur.com/d0K2w9p.png




I am up by quite a bit, but commissiosn rekt me. Still, AAPL has begun its long decent into irrelevance.




Should be red every day now for a little while, as is the case every earnings season in the last 5 years.




Also, at the time of posting this, this post had a score of 666. Coincidence?




For those who asked, yes, I am serious. Some people have written to me trying to change my mind. I want




to say that I appreciate your concerns, advice and help, but that I am 100% dead serious about this. I have




spent a lot of time considering and analysing this and this is what I want to do; I have made my mind and




that nothing you can say or do will change it. Please do not write me telling me to stop this, I am stressed




enough as it is, believe me. I am holding this position through earnings and I am not going to change my




mind. I am ""pretty damn sure"" AAPL will crash massively following earnings and this is what I want to




do. Thank you.




Also, MODS=GODS.




Update #2: Quick explanation to visitors of /r/all who don't get what's going on.

Okay, so you have a stock. A stock is a portion of a company. If company ABC emitted 100 shares and




you had 10 shares, then you own 10% of ABC.




You can buy and sell shares. If you buy a share and it goes up - because other people are willing to pay




more for it - then you make money. If it goes down, you lose money. A stock will go up depending on




what people are ready to pay for it, but generally speaking, a good earnings report will kick the stock up.




Netflix reported good earnings, for instance, and the stock jumped 8%




In addition to stocks, you can also trade what is called options. An option gives you the option to buy or




sell the stock at a later times. There are two popular kind of options: calls and puts.




A call gives you the RIGHT, but not the obligation, to buy the stock at a fixed priced in the future with an




expiration date. The option stops existing after the expiration date (we say it is ""settled""). For instance,




Apple is currently at $122. A call with a strike of $120, expiring on February 17th, 2017, would give you




the right to buy AAPL (Apple's stock ticker) for the price of $120 at any time until February 17th, 2017.




If AAPL crashes to $115 tomorrow, you are not going to ""exercise"" your call. Why would you buy it for




$120 with your call when you can buy it on the open market for less? Similarly, if Apple goes up to $130,




then you would be able to buy it for $120 using your call and resell it for $130 immediately.




A put is the opposite of a call: it gives you the right to SELL at a fixed price. For instance, I bought $120




puts expiring on February 17th, 2017. This gives me the right the sell Apple for $120 at any time until




February 17th, 2017. Apple currently trades for $122, so I am not going to exercise my puts and sell them




for $120 since I can sell them on the general market for $120.




To be noted: you do not need to hold the shares to buy a put. If I exercised my puts today, I would end up




with a negative amount of shares of AAPL, which is called shorting (another topic).




I sold calls, meaning that I gave someone the right to BUY Apple shares from me at the price of $120.




Once again, I do not need to own shares to sell a call: if the guy exercised the call, I would end up with a




negative amount of shares.




Since AAPL is currently at $122, why doesn't he exercise his call right now, i.e. buying it from me at




$120 and selling immediately at $122? Because it can be shown (proved mathematically) that it is never




optimals to exercice a call nor a put before the expiration date, that is, February 17th, 2017.




Now, why would I give someone the right to do that? Because I get paid for it. An option has a premium,




which is the price you pay for that ""right"" (but, again, not the obligation). In other words, if AAPL was to




close under $120 on February 17th, 2017, I would get to keep the entire premium the guy paid me and he




would have nothing.




62




All rights reserved <U+0096> www.FSComeau.com




So my trade is as follows: I sold a mass amount of $120 calls. If AAPL crashes, those calls will not be




exerciced and I get to keep the entire premium.




Using that premium, I bought a mass amount of puts (remember, right to sell). This means that if AAPL




crashes, I get to exercice my puts and earn a lot of money. For instance, I have $120 puts that I paid $1.68




for; if AAPL dips to $110, I would earn $10-$1.68=$8.32.




Because I sold calls and used the money to buy puts, this trade has not cost me a penny. If AAPL crashes,




I could earn a lot. For instance, if it crashes at $80, I would earn $120-$80=$40 on my $120 strike put.




Each contract is for 100 stocks and I have 150 contract, so I would earn 15010040=$600,000. In other




words, if I am right and AAPL crashes after announcing its earnings, on January 31th at 4:00PM, I stand




to make a massive amount of money.




I also bought puts with a strike of $115, $110, $105 and $100. So if Apple dipped to $95, all my puts




would pay me ($120-$95, $115-$95, etc.). The more Apple crashes, the more I make. Ideally, AAPL




would go to $0 and I would earn the maximum amount ($120-$0, $115-$0, etc.)




Of course, you aren't forced to exercise your puts and you can resell them at any time. The price of the put




will go up as AAPL goes down. So if AAPL opens at $99, the $100 put would be worth $1-$5. The exact value depends on complicated mathematics and, overall, how much people are ready to pay for it.









And that's it. Hope it cleared things up a bit! See, options aren't hard =)




","Well, this is it: Going All-in. My last stand. My final Yolo. $2M-5M possible payoff. (NASDAQ:AAPL): To all visitors from /r/all: Please read the explanation at the bottom if you don't understand what's




going on and need explanations on my trades, or what puts and calls are. Thank you.




Three and a half years ago, my favorite uncle died after a short battle with cancer. Up until the moment he




died, none of us even knew he was sick. Uncle Richard was a secretive man who lived a secretive life. He




didn""t like to discuss his personal matters. We saw him once or twice per year, at family gatherings,




where he usually stood alone in a corner, slowly drinking his brandy and seven-up.




I was one of the few people who took the time to go talk to him. Truth be told, I rather enjoyed his




presence. He was a tenacious listener and he had the gift of always making you feel appreciated. After his




wife died in her late 40s, I think he had some kind of breakdown, from which he never recovered. I know




that he truly loved her and the rest of his life was spent living alone in something he sometimes described




to me as an ""unending fog."" Our family invited him because, well, he was part of the family, and also




because he was generous with his bottles of homemade wine, perhaps his only passion in life, or at least




the only one that we knew of.




The day he passed away, I learned he was bequeathing me over 2.5 million dollars.




My uncle had never really had a career or a profession of any kind. He stuck to the usual odd jobs, being a




trucker here, working in security there, even teaching at some point, but he would usually never last long.




When he died, everyone was shocked at the fortune he had managed to amass. But my uncle was an




ascetic and austere man: he lived in the same, tiny house he had built by himself for $10,000 decades ago,




drove a car that was older than me and wore the same clothes quite possibly since his high school times,




year after year. He preferred to repair rather than rebuy and still had that giant, clumsy television from the




80s instead of that shiny new LCD. All in all, it""s crazy to think what an average man, living an average




life, can accumulate over 45 years of his life if he puts his will to the task.




He had no one to give his money to, I guess. No children, no wife and no friends that we knew of. I




remember I was driving back from some boring class at some boring community college when I got the




call. I was so <U+0093>estomaqu<e9><U+0094> (stomached?) I had to pull over on the highway, first of all because I had no




idea he had passed away or that he was even sick, second to ask the notary to repeat the amount he was 




53




All rights reserved <U+0096> www.FSComeau.com




reading to me. Up to that point, I myself had been drifting from a place to another, not unlike him, from a




formation in accounting that led me nowhere to some useless telemarketer job. The call, from his will




executor, changed my life completely.




With his legacy came one small letter, visibly scribbled quickly days before his death, if that, on a single




sheet of paper (loose translation):




<U+0093>Frank,




As a kid, I was told that life was a game. Now that I""m all grown up, I can tell you that life is indeed a




game; just not a very fun one.




R.<U+0094>




And that was it. A few months later, one or two court fights later (some family members tried to contest




the will, of course) and I was a rich man, my life forever changed. My first reaction was to want to place




half in an index fund and now that I look at it today, I can""t tell you how badly I wish I had done that. But




I didn""t and one of the biggest bad streak of my life would soon begin.




I wanted to trade. I had always wanted to trade and the world of daytrading seemed like a utopia to me. At




first, I had success. People might remember my big Apple bet a few years ago where I essentially made




$30,000 in under a week. Looking back at it today, much later, I regret winning that trade. Perhaps if I




had lost everything on that trade, it would have disgusted me from trading forever and I would still have




much of that $2.5M today. But I won, and I won for a good while, and it kept me going.




Then, I began to lose.




I lost $500,000 due to the oil crash in late 2014. I had a ton of Canadian stock (the TSX went down




something like 30% at some point) and many, many oil stocks. I made it all back in early 2015, then lost




it all again in the first six months of the year, plus another $500,000 for the rest of the year. I was




panicking, hardcore, as a million dollars is no small amount to lose, Canadian or American.




I lost $100,000 in one night to Brexit. Another $50,000 betting on Hillary. The summer of 2016




specifically was particularly cruel to me. People who were there will remember that I lost pretty much




every single time. I was tilting, because I knew I was making the right trades, yet losing time after time




after time. But I knew I had done it before and I knew, or at least thought, that I could do it again.




I lost on several failed investments, from a stupid fast-food restaurant I wanted to start (which I won""t




name) to an apartment building where I lost my shirt. I also lost a fortune at the casino, mostly on




blackjack (man, the swings I got) and certainly poker. At my worst, I lost $30,000 in a week playing




$5/$10 poker. I got absolutely horrific hands and I got so many bad beats I stopped counting them. Yeah.




54




All rights reserved <U+0096> www.FSComeau.com




So to make a short story, this brings us to today. From the original amount, I have $325,000 Canadian




left. I have a $100,000 personal loan at 8% (yeah), a $51,000 credit card debt accruing at 19% per year




and various debts ranging from 6 to 10%. Oh man I feel so dumb <U+0096> I could have paid the car I am driving




in cash, but somehow I ended up getting financing because<U+0085> Because.




If I liquidated all my positions and stopped trading today, yes, I could probably repay my debts. And then




what? I would have almost nothing left, nothing at all. My $2.5M would be gone forever and perhaps




most of my mental sanity along with it. What""s the point? Truth be told, at this point, I have really




nothing to lose. Worst case scenario, this yolo fails and I go bankrupt. If I'm going out, well, I'm going




out big. I'd rather take my chance to get my money back.




This is perhaps my last chance in life to <U+0093>hit it big,<U+0094> aka be someone. I won""t get another chance like this.




Look, I""ll be blunt: I want my two point five million back. It""s mine and I want it back, period. Unless




you""ve hit it big and lost it all, you don""t know how incredibly painful it is to look at $325,000 and think,




<U+0093>Yeah, this used to be 7 times higher.<U+0094>




And here comes the Yolo.




I began my career with Apple, I""m ending it with Apple. No matter what happens, this is going to be my




final Yolo. I""m sorry, I wish I could continue, but I""m tired of trading. It's morally and emotionally




exhausted and over the last two years, it's really taken a huge toll of my health, both mental and physical.




Some of you might have noticed the (subtle) changes in my personality and demeanors. It is time for me




to stop making a fool out of myself and stop suffering. I am tired of perpetually losing money. That




Google trade was the last straw. Even though I called the earnings perfectly, I still somehow lost money.




The stock market is rigged and I am done with it.




People who know me well know that I am an Apple expert. Without a doubt, Apple is my specialty. I




called the exact iPhones sales, revenues and estimates pretty much every quarter, and I can tell you Apple




is about to get a massive miss. Notice how there is no real <U+0093>hype<U+0094> around those earnings? That""s because




for the first time in, like, forever, Apple has failed majorly. They don""t want to foam around it because




they know very well it""s going to be catastrophic.




iPhone sales will be down 10-15% - and that will be the good part of their earnings report. iPads are




basically dead. The iPad pro is nothing more than a joke. It probably sold less than the Pixel. Okay, not




that bad, but trust me, iPad sales have been terrible for a while and this time, they""ll be so bad Apple




might actually throw in the towel. Truth be told, Apple is 2+ years late and 5+ years late in some sectors




when compared to the industry.




55




All rights reserved <U+0096> www.FSComeau.com




And apart from iPhone and iPads, What else does Apple has at this point? Mac sales are down, the iPod is




dead, the Apple Watch<U+0085> let""s not even mention the Apple Watch lol. What else does Apple have? iTunes




revenues? That""s like a billion dollars, who cares.




Look at recent tech earnings: Google, WDC, QCOM<U+0085> All freaking terrible! The entire sector is going




down and Apple, with its overpriced crap (it almost hurts me to write that) is at the forefront. An iPhone




is up to $ 1,400 here. I mean, like, what were they thinking?




I could go on and on explaining why Apple is going to crater after earnings. Basically, it almost always




does. Look at the past earnings: even when it did beat earnings estimates, it crashed afterwards. Apple is




just a very emotional stock and people like to mass sell it after earnings. And with how bad things are,




there is no chance in hell Apple will beat earnings.




Apple is not dead, but it""s going to slowly drift down into the abyss (See: Blackberry, Nokia, etc.). No




one can remain at the top forever and with so many companies producing phones, many of them far better




than the iPhone, it simply doesn""t stand a chance. I mean, the iPhone is like 65% of the profits. And this




brings me to my main points: the iPhone 7 is a fiasco. Worst, it is going against the VERY popular and




lucrative iPhone 6s (the <U+0093>S<U+0094> series always earns Apple more profits as the machines are already




calibrated) AND the strongest line of Android phones of all times.




Okay, name me ONE thing about the iPhone 7. Go! When you think iPhone 7, you think<U+0085>




<U+0085> no headphone jack. That""s it. The iPhone 7 has no headphone jack. I dare you to name me ONE thing




that is different with the iPhone 7 when compared to the 6s. Go. Without looking it up, even I couldn""t




find anything. And when your main selling point is a feature disappearing, it""s not good.




For the first time in like forever, it seems the iPhone had no hype at all. Perhaps everyone has one yet,




perhaps no one saw enough reason to upgrade (waiting for 7s?) or perhaps no one cared, but I can tell you




the iPhone 7 is an astounding failure. Oh, they sold tens of millions, but it""s plain and simply not enough.




Have you seen many people with an iPhone 7? Have you seen many people with an Apple Watch (which




has been turned into the subject of a mockery) Yeah, I thought so.




In simple words, Apple has lost it. It went from being a simple company with a simple product line to




some jammed messed. Everyone remembers the iPhone. There was ONE iPhone and one iPhone alone.




Now, there are something like 10 different iPhones available with so many options nobody knows what's




going on. iPhone 7, 6, 6 plus, 6s, 6s plus, Se... What the hell is that? And I'm not even speaking of the 20




different colors that make no sense. And just look at the Apple Watch and try to understand what's going




on: apple watch 2, apple watch Nike+, apple watch hermes, apple watch edition, apple watch 1...




Seriously what the heck is that thing?




56




All rights reserved <U+0096> www.FSComeau.com




Speaking of technology, Apple has fallen so far behind it's not funny anymore. The iPhone SE still comes




with 16GB!!! Sixteen GB!!!!! Is this some kind of joke? My operating system takes more than 16 GB!




How many minutes of video can you record with 16GB! Compare that to Android which often come with




SD cards and possibly terabytes of data and you've got a real joke on your hand. And almost every




Android phone outperforms the iPhone in every mark. The iPhone isn't even the top phone anywhere




anymore - it's gone, people!




All in all, we face the same problems we faced in 2012 when Apple""s stock crashed from $100 to $60:




dying business lines (iPod at the time) and no innovation at all. Apple was able to save face once, and




then again, not really: it underperformed the index from 2012 to today, only going up 20% in 5 years in a




period where the S&amp;P500 basically doubled. Tomorrow""s dreadful earnings will mark the end of Apple as




an innovative company as we know it. It will now be priced as a commodity company and this implies a




much, much lower valuation.




Google is still able to grow. Microsoft is still about to grow. Apple is about to report a sharp drop in




earnings, around 15-20% and perhaps as large as 25%, if they are honest (they can still fudge the number




somewhat). With much lower iPhone sales, it""s simply not possible for them to beat the very inflated




earnings estimates. This sharp drop in earnings, coupled with a terrible guidance for the rest of 2017




(strong USD, world tensions due to Trump, Apple failing in China <U+0096> all points I don""t have time to cover,




but which are very valid) will lead to Apple getting one of the biggest hits in the history of hits.




I""ll be blunt: Apple will drop 8-10% in afterhours (maybe more), it will open down 15% the next day and




end the day down more 20%. Yes, that""s how bad it is. And I""ll be there to earn a fortune from it. As I




said, I want my millions back.




My #Yolo is designed in a very specific way. It""s designed so that even if I am wrong (which I am not), I




will not lose money. Yep, it's that good. Before I try to explain it to you, let me explain this: I am 99.9%




certain AAPL is going to plummet post-earnings, but as there always is no way for me to know for sure.




There is so much market manipulation some banks might keep it from falling more than 2-3% just to be




able to liquidate their calls at the opening bell, etc. For this reason, I chose longer- expiration options as




Apple will most likely keep dropping in the days to follow (as more and more people realize Apple is the




next Blackberry and start selling their fund. People can""t liquidate a $2-3B position overnight). Thus, I




chose the monthly, February 17th expiration. Big manipulators might be able to manipulate the price




somewhat, but not very long.




57

I also made my trade voluntarily more complex to account for all possible scenarios (more on that later). I




have been screwed by big funds before and I have designed this trade so that even if I get screwed, I




won""t lose money.




So, without further ado, here is my yolo:




1) I bought $120 puts, twice the amount of $115 puts, 4 times the amount of $110 puts, 8 times the




amount of $105 puts and 16 times of $100 puts. Those are unbelievably cheap ATM. TOTAL COST:




$100,000 USD.




2) To cover the premium paid for those puts, I sold a massive amount of $120 calls. I used the entire




premium to buy the puts (and the calls below).




3) To be allowed to make that trade (margin requirement is crazy on naked calls), I bought a ton of $128




calls. This is a vertical spread which allows me to do the trade as I want it. Of course, there is no chance




AAPL is $128 after earnings, but without those calls, I would need a $2M+ cushion in margin, which I




don""t have (anymore). TOTAL CREDIT: $100,000 USD.




4) All in all, this trade has cost me nothing to do :D. That""s right: $0 upfront cost! Free!




5) To get the margin required for this trade, I had to sell all my long-term stocks and ALL my other plays.




Some of the margin is also taken from my Credit card but at this point, it doesn""t make a difference.




A 100K YOLO FOR 100K WSB SUBSCRIBERS! If you want to have fun, draw the payout that comes




from this strategy.




So, what will happen on earnings? Well, simply said: IT IS SIMPLY NOT POSSIBLE FOR APPLE TO




SPIKE UP POST-EARNINGS. It didn""t happen to Google, it didn""t happen to Western Digital,




Qualcomm or even Intel or Microsoft (2%! Yay!), despite excellent earnings (which Apple won""t have). 




58




All rights reserved <U+0096> www.FSComeau.com




Based on that, here are all the possible scenarios that could happen, ranked from worst to best, along with




what would happen to me:




1) The Google Gambit: Big funds play the <U+0093>oh they had one below average quarter but they are still




growing and they have huge product lines coming (yeah, right)<U+0094> <U+0096> stock miraculously only drops 1-2%




(like GOOG) is - I don""t make any money, but I don""t lose any either. I""m pissed off. Likelihood:&lt; 1%




2) The Qualcomm Quack: Apple somehow miraculously saves face by playing with




inventories/supplies/doing Valeant stuff. Then, the stock would drop only 3-4%. I would make a little bit




of money. Likelihood: 4%




3) The <U+0093>we barely got away with that one<U+0094> scenario: Apple cheats and starts buying its own iPhones to




prevent the number from crumbling too bad. It""s a bad quarter, but not too bad. Apple crashes to $118 in




AH and then drifts down to $115. I essentially double my money, a $100,000 gain. Likelihood: 20%




4) The <U+0093>last minute wildcard<U+0094> scenario: Apple somehow managed to earn more than I thought on some




miracle play (hedging). Earnings are down by quite a bit. Apple crashes to $115 and barely stays above




$110 in the next few trading sessions. I essentially quadruple my money, a $300,000 gain. Likelihood:




25%




5) The <U+0093>Back in the Basement<U+0094> Scenario: Apple is honest about its terrible quarter and results, but




downplays it and people somehow buy it. Apple crashes to $112 in AH and drifts down to $105 by Feb




17. I essentially sixtuple my money. A $500,000 gain. Likelihood:15%




6) The Meltdown Scenario Apple: is honest about its terrible quarter and investors aren""t dumb. They




mass sell the stock. It crumbles to $105 in AH and some idiots buy it thinking it""s a <U+0093>bargain.<U+0094> I make




over a million overnight and another $250,000 in the days that follow. It crashes to $95 by Feb 17.




*Likelihood: 25% *




7) The <U+0093>Hillary Clinton Scenario<U+0094>: It""s worse than I thought. Tim Cook apologizes and steps down, citing




personal problems. Apple plummets below $100 in AH. People panic, everyone wants to sell, it""s on the




top of every newspapers. It opens at $101 the next day, immediately gaps below $97 and then spiral down




to $90 where it belongs (maybe even lower, but let""s keep it at that). I more than fiftytuple my money,




making $5,000,000. *Likelihood: 10% *




So, what is the expected expectancy of that trade? it""s 1% * $0 + 4% * $15,000 + 20% * $100,000 + 25%




* $300,000 +15% * $500,000 + 25% * $1,150,000 + 10% *$5,000,000= $958,100.




Here""s a graph with possible payouts. The top column shows the price of apple, the leftmost row the gain




for each put (remember, $0 initial cost <U+0096> costs are covered):

Understand this: Apple WILL drop post-earnings. There is absolutely no way whatsoever it can go up. It




can""t happen. I mean, Google is down by quite a bit after its earnings, the entire tech sector is down, but




AAPL somehow stays at $122. Okay. I am hoping for a massive, massive, MASSIVE drop obviously. I




wouldn""t be satisfied with Apple dropping to $115, for example.




I expect to make close to a million from that trade, although there is a lot of possible variance. Obviously,




I wouldn""t be happy with the $100,000 scenario as this is my chance, and probably my last chance, to get




my money back. Note that even if apple doesn""t go below $100, my $100 strike puts will gain in value if




Apple drops to $109 post-earnings, so I might make a bit more there.




I want to thank everyone on /r/wsb for the continued and unending support. You have truly helped me get




to where I am and I just want to say that no matter what happens, I""ll have no regret. You have




entertained me during dark times in my life and quite possibly saved me. You guys never failed to make




me laugh with your puns, memes and other and for this, I especially thank you <U+0096> especially those who




were generous enough to become my patrons or get me reddit gold.




One final thing. I don""t know if God exists. I won""t pretend that I suddenly believe in Him (or Her), like




so many do in their time of need, but if you do exist God: please, please, please, please, please help me. I




have never been lucky in this life and you have thrown many obstacles in my way, but if you help me




here, everything is forgiven. It""s not that hard to break that $100 floor and once that happens, it""s game




over <U+0096> I""m rich. I know the earnings are going to suck. Don""t let big banks screw me once again.




If I do win, here is my promise:




1) I WILL repay all my debts, in full, immediately.




2) I WILL place half the money in a long-term fund that pays 4-5% per year. Banks, Telecoms, Pipelines,




etc.




3) I WILL use a quarter of the money to buy a house and plenty of nice things.




4) I WILL use the last quarter of the money to travel the world, enjoying life.




5) I SWEAR ON EVERYTHING THAT I AM AND EVERYTHING THAT I HAVE THAT I WILL




NEVER, EVER, EVER TRADE AGAIN.




In therapy, I was told that the most important thing was being honest with yourself. I""ll be honest with




yourself and also myself: I""m not a good trader. I""m so tired of losing. I wasted two years of my life on 




60

this bullshit. No matter what happens, this is my last trade. After that, I am moving on and never, ever




even thinking about finance or stock ever again. Two years of perpetually losing money are enough for




me. But recently, I have been on a hot streak (100% success recently) and I just need the streak to last




one. last. time.




Verdict: Massively short AAPL through earnings.




AS LONG AS APPLE DOESN""T GO UP, I DO NOT LOSE MONEY. GLTA.

will cost me $65k-$85k to ship it all at a discount, assuming all US and CAN addresses. Other shippers




might be cheaper, I guess I'll see. DISCLAIMER: Limited to the first 10,000 posters, reserved to people

Quick update for those who asked (damn you, reddit formatting system! I'd short you if you had earnings




coming!) http://i.imgur.com/d0K2w9p.png




I am up by quite a bit, but commissiosn rekt me. Still, AAPL has begun its long decent into irrelevance.




Should be red every day now for a little while, as is the case every earnings season in the last 5 years.




Also, at the time of posting this, this post had a score of 666. Coincidence?




For those who asked, yes, I am serious. Some people have written to me trying to change my mind. I want




to say that I appreciate your concerns, advice and help, but that I am 100% dead serious about this. I have




spent a lot of time considering and analysing this and this is what I want to do; I have made my mind and




that nothing you can say or do will change it. Please do not write me telling me to stop this, I am stressed




enough as it is, believe me. I am holding this position through earnings and I am not going to change my




mind. I am ""pretty damn sure"" AAPL will crash massively following earnings and this is what I want to




do. Thank you.




Also, MODS=GODS.




Update #2: Quick explanation to visitors of /r/all who don't get what's going on.

Okay, so you have a stock. A stock is a portion of a company. If company ABC emitted 100 shares and




you had 10 shares, then you own 10% of ABC.




You can buy and sell shares. If you buy a share and it goes up - because other people are willing to pay




more for it - then you make money. If it goes down, you lose money. A stock will go up depending on




what people are ready to pay for it, but generally speaking, a good earnings report will kick the stock up.




Netflix reported good earnings, for instance, and the stock jumped 8%




In addition to stocks, you can also trade what is called options. An option gives you the option to buy or




sell the stock at a later times. There are two popular kind of options: calls and puts.




A call gives you the RIGHT, but not the obligation, to buy the stock at a fixed priced in the future with an




expiration date. The option stops existing after the expiration date (we say it is ""settled""). For instance,




Apple is currently at $122. A call with a strike of $120, expiring on February 17th, 2017, would give you




the right to buy AAPL (Apple's stock ticker) for the price of $120 at any time until February 17th, 2017.




If AAPL crashes to $115 tomorrow, you are not going to ""exercise"" your call. Why would you buy it for




$120 with your call when you can buy it on the open market for less? Similarly, if Apple goes up to $130,




then you would be able to buy it for $120 using your call and resell it for $130 immediately.




A put is the opposite of a call: it gives you the right to SELL at a fixed price. For instance, I bought $120




puts expiring on February 17th, 2017. This gives me the right the sell Apple for $120 at any time until




February 17th, 2017. Apple currently trades for $122, so I am not going to exercise my puts and sell them




for $120 since I can sell them on the general market for $120.




To be noted: you do not need to hold the shares to buy a put. If I exercised my puts today, I would end up




with a negative amount of shares of AAPL, which is called shorting (another topic).




I sold calls, meaning that I gave someone the right to BUY Apple shares from me at the price of $120.




Once again, I do not need to own shares to sell a call: if the guy exercised the call, I would end up with a




negative amount of shares.




Since AAPL is currently at $122, why doesn't he exercise his call right now, i.e. buying it from me at




$120 and selling immediately at $122? Because it can be shown (proved mathematically) that it is never




optimals to exercice a call nor a put before the expiration date, that is, February 17th, 2017.




Now, why would I give someone the right to do that? Because I get paid for it. An option has a premium,




which is the price you pay for that ""right"" (but, again, not the obligation). In other words, if AAPL was to




close under $120 on February 17th, 2017, I would get to keep the entire premium the guy paid me and he




would have nothing.




62




All rights reserved <U+0096> www.FSComeau.com




So my trade is as follows: I sold a mass amount of $120 calls. If AAPL crashes, those calls will not be




exerciced and I get to keep the entire premium.




Using that premium, I bought a mass amount of puts (remember, right to sell). This means that if AAPL




crashes, I get to exercice my puts and earn a lot of money. For instance, I have $120 puts that I paid $1.68




for; if AAPL dips to $110, I would earn $10-$1.68=$8.32.




Because I sold calls and used the money to buy puts, this trade has not cost me a penny. If AAPL crashes,




I could earn a lot. For instance, if it crashes at $80, I would earn $120-$80=$40 on my $120 strike put.




Each contract is for 100 stocks and I have 150 contract, so I would earn 15010040=$600,000. In other




words, if I am right and AAPL crashes after announcing its earnings, on January 31th at 4:00PM, I stand




to make a massive amount of money.




I also bought puts with a strike of $115, $110, $105 and $100. So if Apple dipped to $95, all my puts




would pay me ($120-$95, $115-$95, etc.). The more Apple crashes, the more I make. Ideally, AAPL




would go to $0 and I would earn the maximum amount ($120-$0, $115-$0, etc.)




Of course, you aren't forced to exercise your puts and you can resell them at any time. The price of the put




will go up as AAPL goes down. So if AAPL opens at $99, the $100 put would be worth $1-$5. The exact value depends on complicated mathematics and, overall, how much people are ready to pay for it.









And that's it. Hope it cleared things up a bit! See, options aren't hard =)

Is the workout at home trade done? Intel stops the bleeding while Apple loses lawsuit. Let<U+0092>s talk about this and other stock market news**









Hello everyone and Good Morning! So, let<U+0092>s start with the recap of yesterday, as we saw all 3 big indexes closing the day in the red despite hitting intraday records, with the [NASDAQ COMPOSITE](https://ibb.co/PCN8dwz) losing .38%, while both the broad market [SP500](https://ibb.co/cDjpNKP) and the [DOW JONES](https://ibb.co/RydQj61) Industrial finished the day down just over .2% as we also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/44wGzR0) rising by more than 4% yesterday as the $2000 stimulus was [BLOCKED](https://ibb.co/WFNSpCH) in the Senate by McConnell and the Georgia Senate runoff election is just a week away.









Almost 70% of the [COMPANIES](https://ibb.co/LYM4JfL) were declining yesterday on below average volume as the number of companies that were trading above the 50-day moving average fell under 70% for the first time in quite a while.









We saw 9 of the 11 [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/GRJSmht) closing in the red yesterday, with only the Health Care and Consumer Discretionary sectors having small gains as almost all the types of companies were losing ground [YESTERDAY](https://ibb.co/7tKPyP4), especially the small-caps with the small-cap growth group losing more than 2%.









Here is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/KjVsn9X) from yesterday, it<U+0092>s mostly red, with only a couple of companies that were gaining big like the Chinese companies alongside Amazon and Intel.HEAT









We also got some economic data yesterday, as a review of the 2020 aviation and air travel [ESTIMATED](https://ibb.co/hRbYxpG) that traffic will be down 67% since last year, dropping to levels not seen since 1999, as air travel is still struggling to come back after the march bottoms. This has affected most of the [COMPANIES](https://ibb.co/FBq4g37) worldwide but it seems that China airlines is doing somewhat better with the biggest percentage of the total number of flights completed compared to last year.









The SP Home price [INDICES](https://ibb.co/W67RBYh) also came in better than expected with the National Index increasing by 1.4% M/M, as this is a leading measure of real estate prices, gaining 8.4% nationwide over year ago. 









These moves can also be seen in the latest Redfin report, as home sales [PRICES](https://ibb.co/CwR5H56) are up 14% year/year to over $320K with a great increase in pending [SALES](https://ibb.co/mJtrwV9) which are also up more than 34% since last year, as the number of active [LISTINGS](https://ibb.co/vVkfMMh) of home sales is down more than 30%, as buyers can<U+0092>t snatch them up quick enough with such low [YIELDS](https://ibb.co/7j1kY3s), as this has led for the [AVERAGE](https://ibb.co/gzQq8Wb) sale price to list value to rise to 99.4% which Is up 1.5% since 2019. This should be good news for companies like Toll Brothers, Lennar, HD and LOW.









This was also accompanied by the great numbers in the us chain store sales [NUMBERS](https://ibb.co/4PykPcH), which rose by almost 9% y/y with December sales expected to rise almost 5% since last year and a .2% increase since last month.









While [TODAY](https://ibb.co/8N3YMPV) we start the day with MBA Mortgage applications, home sales and the Chicago PMI alongside advance reads on many other data points.









In some other stock market [NEWS](https://ibb.co/q1J6Snv), we saw Apple cool of a little yesterday, losing more than 1% for the day while they also lost a lawsuit aimed of stopping Corellium using virtual iPhone for security researching in the operating system, while [INTEL](https://ibb.co/3vvXFGT) finally got a breather and recovered some of the recent loses, after an activist hedge fund manager pushed for strategic changes in the company as Intel is losing market share and top designers, with the company also [ISSUING](https://ibb.co/WgtwTrY) a statement that lifted spirits around the stock.









We also saw the [FAA](https://ibb.co/6rJ6bHd) introduce new rules for drones, this may have a big impact on companies like UPS, Walmart and Amazon, as all of them have started trials for drone-delivery, as this could lead to better margins for the companies.









The Fed also [EXTENDED](https://ibb.co/cxV3HkC) the main street lending programs until Jan. 8 with the approval of Mnuchin as they try to process a bunch of applications this month, this means we can get even more money put into the economy and eventually the stock markets which is good news.









And meanwhile, AstraZeneca<U+0092>s vaccine was [APPROVED](https://ibb.co/y5QWbmh) for emergency use in the UK, this is another weapon to find this freaking illness, while JNJ will give us some results in early 2021 and Novavax just started their trial in the US.









Also, one last piece of data that I found recently shows that there was indeed a huge spike this [YEAR](https://ibb.co/JrKw01B) in the move to live streaming video and pre-recorded videos this year, as this has boosted companies like Peloton, Lululemon and others.









But this trend is seen slowing down in the next years with just a 4% [CAGR](https://ibb.co/HGhFJXS) in the equipment market, but that the exercise apps will see a big [GROWTH](https://ibb.co/02wm273) in the next years, so there are 2 different POV. I wouldn<U+0092>t stay invested in companies like PTON right now, I<U+0092>d rather take profits and move to other areas in the stock market. But don<U+0092>t rush into companies like AMC which have diluted their stock a lot or have lots of debt<U+0085> this will not recover so fast, with [AMC](https://ibb.co/gDR8S81) filling to share up to 50M shares.









Let<U+0092>s hope for a good day in the market as US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/nbV49Bs) seem to be pointing at a good open, with all 3 big indexes in the green as the Nasdaq is leading the way.

We also got some economic data yesterday, as a review of the 2020 aviation and air travel [ESTIMATED](https://ibb.co/hRbYxpG) that traffic will be down 67% since last year, dropping to levels not seen since 1999, as air travel is still struggling to come back after the march bottoms. This has affected most of the [COMPANIES](https://ibb.co/FBq4g37) worldwide but it seems that China airlines is doing somewhat better with the biggest percentage of the total number of flights completed compared to last year.









The SP Home price [INDICES](https://ibb.co/W67RBYh) also came in better than expected with the National Index increasing by 1.4% M/M, as this is a leading measure of real estate prices, gaining 8.4% nationwide over year ago. 









These moves can also be seen in the latest Redfin report, as home sales [PRICES](https://ibb.co/CwR5H56) are up 14% year/year to over $320K with a great increase in pending [SALES](https://ibb.co/mJtrwV9) which are also up more than 34% since last year, as the number of active [LISTINGS](https://ibb.co/vVkfMMh) of home sales is down more than 30%, as buyers can<U+0092>t snatch them up quick enough with such low [YIELDS](https://ibb.co/7j1kY3s), as this has led for the [AVERAGE](https://ibb.co/gzQq8Wb) sale price to list value to rise to 99.4% which Is up 1.5% since 2019. This should be good news for companies like Toll Brothers, Lennar, HD and LOW.









This was also accompanied by the great numbers in the us chain store sales [NUMBERS](https://ibb.co/4PykPcH), which rose by almost 9% y/y with December sales expected to rise almost 5% since last year and a .2% increase since last month.









While [TODAY](https://ibb.co/8N3YMPV) we start the day with MBA Mortgage applications, home sales and the Chicago PMI alongside advance reads on many other data points.









In some other stock market [NEWS](https://ibb.co/q1J6Snv), we saw Apple cool of a little yesterday, losing more than 1% for the day while they also lost a lawsuit aimed of stopping Corellium using virtual iPhone for security researching in the operating system, while [INTEL](https://ibb.co/3vvXFGT) finally got a breather and recovered some of the recent loses, after an activist hedge fund manager pushed for strategic changes in the company as Intel is losing market share and top designers, with the company also [ISSUING](https://ibb.co/WgtwTrY) a statement that lifted spirits around the stock.









We also saw the [FAA](https://ibb.co/6rJ6bHd) introduce new rules for drones, this may have a big impact on companies like UPS, Walmart and Amazon, as all of them have started trials for drone-delivery, as this could lead to better margins for the companies.









The Fed also [EXTENDED](https://ibb.co/cxV3HkC) the main street lending programs until Jan. 8 with the approval of Mnuchin as they try to process a bunch of applications this month, this means we can get even more money put into the economy and eventually the stock markets which is good news.









And meanwhile, AstraZeneca<U+0092>s vaccine was [APPROVED](https://ibb.co/y5QWbmh) for emergency use in the UK, this is another weapon to find this freaking illness, while JNJ will give us some results in early 2021 and Novavax just started their trial in the US.









Also, one last piece of data that I found recently shows that there was indeed a huge spike this [YEAR](https://ibb.co/JrKw01B) in the move to live streaming video and pre-recorded videos this year, as this has boosted companies like Peloton, Lululemon and others.









But this trend is seen slowing down in the next years with just a 4% [CAGR](https://ibb.co/HGhFJXS) in the equipment market, but that the exercise apps will see a big [GROWTH](https://ibb.co/02wm273) in the next years, so there are 2 different POV. I wouldn<U+0092>t stay invested in companies like PTON right now, I<U+0092>d rather take profits and move to other areas in the stock market. But don<U+0092>t rush into companies like AMC which have diluted their stock a lot or have lots of debt<U+0085> this will not recover so fast, with [AMC](https://ibb.co/gDR8S81) filling to share up to 50M shares.









Let<U+0092>s hope for a good day in the market as US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/nbV49Bs) seem to be pointing at a good open, with all 3 big indexes in the green as the Nasdaq is leading the way.

As per title I am a current Apple employee in the UK and I started investing in their ESPP plan 2 years ago, with an average of my income going in to it of 8%.




I currently hold 49 stocks for a total of about 7500$ and every year in October I get 6 RSU with a current value of 300$ and a potential of 3700$ (which will get there in 2019).




I was thinking of selling some of the stocks, considering that the <U+00A3> is getting weak and because it's traded in USD I might be able to get a little bit more money than before. I use Etrade as a platform (setup by the employer) and they charge 6.99$ per wire transfer to my bank account.

93,sn7dj,AAPL,"The ""Liquid Metal"" iPhone story has only exploded bigger over the weekend.  This should be an interesting Monday for LQMT and AAPL, especially with Apple's earnings coming out Tuesday.  Also, because I got tired of being called a troll...: More facts learned during the weekend research:  




  




- Apple paid the $20 Million to license the liquid metal technology to LQMT in 2010, in terms which are not completely disclosed.  It is unlikely that further royalties would be paid by Apple, but not impossible.  What is most lucrative is that the iPhone would 'kick-start' the technology and it would become an *extremely* hot item for lots of different industries.  




  




- Liquidmetal is (getting away from all the magic internet hype) simply a way to form a metal alloy without allowing the atoms to form lattice-like structures, thereby creating a substance that is **2.5 times stronger than Titanium**, but is more flexible and just as light.  This is not magic, but it is pretty fucking amazing.  




  




- Apple would likely be actually producing any liquid metal tech through a secondary manufacturer like Engel or Materion, especially if used in this generation iPhone.    




  




- Apple has spent billions on non-disclosed costs in the past few quarters relating to creating new manufacturing facilities.  




    




- Upon being contacted by news sources for confirmation of the rumors, Apple declined to comment.  




  




So, I'm not saying that LQMT is invincible, but it damn sure is not the dismal penny stock is was a month ago with no hopes.  




  




And I'm damned sure I didn't let the butt-hurts and the haters here convince me not to put 100% of my capital in it Friday morning/afternoon.   




  




Also, I got tired of being called a troll, so to show everyone that I am in fact, a legit person, I screen-capped my account and recent trading history (with certain details censored that I feel would give away a little *too* much personal information).  You'll see that I have told no lies here, and mean what I say.  




  




**http://i.imgur.com/55PDr.png**  




  




**(edit: I sold my positions at a certain point, and then rebought in at a lower point.  At this point I am stuck here at least until tomorrow if I don't want a day trading margin call, so I'm in it for a bit.  I will update within 48 hours of my situation, probably with another screen-cap unless I embarass myself too badly)**","The ""Liquid Metal"" iPhone story has only exploded bigger over the weekend.

Tons of open interest over the next 2 weeks around the 130/131 strike will likely keep this from going far from these strikes without a catalyst to overcome option volume.

At one point, AAPL was considering developing their own semiconductors, wireless components, etc, that they currently outsource from AVGO.

But anyway, with the current climate and increasing fed rates this year (which might even be as low as 0.25% so potentially negligible), does it make it reasonable to assume that AAPL may hold off on spending on that semiconductor development for a while, making AVGO a pretty good shot at below $600 entry right now?

Here is the action in after hours trading: http://i.imgur.com/yPPgy.gif









[Reuters](http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/10/18/us-apple-idUSTRE79G2U520111018) - Apple Inc reported a rare miss in quarterly results after sales of its flagship iPhone fell well short of Wall Street expectations, hammering its shares.









Shares of the world's most valuable technology corporation dived more than 5 percent to below $400 after it said it sold 17.07 million iPhones -- well short of the roughly 20 million expected by analysts.









Apple's CFO said iPhone sales came in ahead of internal expectations but were hurt in September by customers waiting for a new version.









The September quarterly report was Apple's first under new Chief Executive Tim Cook, who took over in August after co-founder Steve Jobs resigned. The company lost its leading visionary and co-founder when he died October 5.









Cook takes over during a critical juncture for the company, which is battling a fast-rising Google Inc in the mobile arena while fending off consumer electronics giants such as Samsung and Amazon.com Inc.









""Expectations for this company were red-hot, that is why we downgraded it,"" said BGC Partners analyst Colin Gillis, who lowered his rating on the shares days before. ""The reality is their business is not an annuity. They have to sell their quarter's worth of revenue every 90 days.""









""They had a big upgrade cycle with the iPhone, the numbers came in weak. They need to set records every time they report to keep up the momentum.""

166,nh6ijq,AAPL,"AAPL - Potential Daily Head and Shoulders pattern breaking: Looking closely at how the next couple of days go in AAPL. If we see a reversal back to the down side there could be a large pullback since this would confirm a daily head and shoulders break to the down side. Looking for a measured move from head the neckline, which falls the in the range of also filling a gap @ $96.19.









https://preview.redd.it/5vud70vi9b071.png?width=2612&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2683dbb1bd8257c82ad5a0133e2f5b01e0feeaa4









Also, this past week AAPL has been testing it's 200 day moving average. If we continue the rally strong from this area then it will invalidate the head and shoulders pattern outlined above. If we close below that (currently @ $123.69) that would give more confirmation of this head and shoulders break to the downside.









Another point of interest is that the SlowRSI is currently @ 33.29. Typically a bottom is put in when this reaches the 20 level or below. This itself is no reason for a pullback, but everything said put together strengthens the pullback argument.









All said and done, I am bullish on AAPL but believe we need to see a deep pullback in order for it to be more attractive to the masses and drive more volume into the stock. After this potential pullback I can see AAPL rallying hard to the upside, so pay attention and be patient for a good entry.","AAPL - Potential Daily Head and Shoulders pattern breaking: Looking closely at how the next couple of days go in AAPL. If we see a reversal back to the down side there could be a large pullback since this would confirm a daily head and shoulders break to the down side. Looking for a measured move from head the neckline, which falls the in the range of also filling a gap @ $96.19.

Also, this past week AAPL has been testing it's 200 day moving average. If we continue the rally strong from this area then it will invalidate the head and shoulders pattern outlined above. If we close below that (currently @ $123.69) that would give more confirmation of this head and shoulders break to the downside.

169,iy9388,AAPL,"AAPL for MSFT?: Hello everyone!









I recently learned that my grandmother had been buying stocks for me and my other siblings since we were born. She didn<U+0092>t know much (neither do I lol), but would just buy whatever was promising or popular at the time. So I have an account now that is almost exclusively MSFT stock because that was on the rise at the time, and as it performed better she bought more. I have some stock in other places, but it<U+0092>s all mainly tech.









I was planning to either save up and buy more stock in other sectors to diversify, or sell some of the MSFT stock and use that to buy other stock. 









My question is would it be a good move to sell off a chunk of that MSFT stock and put it in AAPL instead? I<U+0092>ve been hearing rumblings the past few weeks that Apple has something coming out soon called Apple-Fi that is apparently supposed to be groundbreaking (no idea how factual the information is though). 









I know it would just be taking it from one tech stock and putting it in another, but if this wifi anywhere through the air thing is actually real, it would probably boost Apple<U+0092>s stock a good bit, right? Also, it feels risky having almost entirely MSFT stock because you never know what could happen.

190,1038ft,AAPL,"Thoughts on AAPL: The iPhone 5's recent success was due to two factors, IMO.









First, LTE. I know of many individuals who preordered/looking to upgrade for the better mobile coverage. Now that its here, it's an expectation and not a benefit, in terms of future iPhones.









Second, scheduling. Apple has historically released iPhones in late June/July. The iPhone 4 was released on AT&amp;T on June 24, 2010. BUT, the iPhone 4S was released October 14, 2011, likely due to delays from the Japanese tsunami. The iPhone 5 will be released nearly 3 months after 2 year contracts are due up from the iPhone 4 on AT&amp;T. Verizon iPhone 4's were released Feb of 2011 so they don't count in this equation.









This is all to say that the next iPhone could have poor sales, on paper, unless Apple waits again until October to release (which I would call doubtful), because all of the iPhone 4S users will have to wait until at least October to get an upgrade price ($400 lower, I believe). The bit of saving grace could be Verizon users who have waited from February 2011 until iPhone 6, late summer 2013.









With the iPhone being a massive part of Apple's value, I don't think this bodes well for the stock price.









ALSO, in the computer industry, the hardware and operating system rarely matter any more, as a user can get roughly the same services on either a Windows or Mac machine, including the Windows operating system. The smart phone market, in regards to iOS vs Android, seems to be quickly approaching that. With this latest iPhone 5, Apple has shown that true innovation has been harder to come by, and many of the features are simply catching up to the more often upgraded Android. Apple still holds great competitive advantages in usability, but that hasn't gotten them *all that far* in the computer market, but their business there *is* growing. They may lose some of their more tech savvy iPhone users to Android, as usability [isn't so much a factor to some people](http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/print/9231403/The_iPhone_Apple_was_forced_to_make).









Also I think Jeff Bezos (Amazon) has his sights set on Apple and represents a real threat to the sustained dominance of the iPad. But this post is long enough already.









**TLDR: I think Apple is slipping in terms of potential and in terms of having an easy road to cruise down. Sales for the next iPhone won't be as great.

105,5y4ytc,AAPL,"[DD] $NOK and $AAPL Lawsuit (x-post r/wsb): Here's some DD I promised over the newest lawsuits between $NOK and $AAPL. You can read the complaint [here](https://www.scribd.com/document/334791198/16-12-20-Apple-Complaint-v-Acacia-Et-Al#from_embed) at your leisure.









Apple has filed suit in federal court against various defendants, which includes Nokia and two of its subsidiaries. To start, the case is in its very early stages. To this date, Apple is the only party which has filed a pleading (a document stating your initial stance on the law suit). None of the defendants have filed an answer (another type of pleading) dictating which allegations they admit or deny in the Apple complaint. 









Regarding Nokia, Apple alleges that Nokia breached a contract and violated various section of the Sherman Act, which, in its most basic form, is a law meant to prevent monopolies. The contract which Apple claims was breached, actually does not have Apple as a party to it. The contract was between Nokia and some of the other defendants, but Apple alleges that it can bring a claim for breach because the contract affects them. 









The other defendants here are companies that make money by acquiring patents and litigating or licensing them--they are essentially patent trolls. Nokia entered into an agreement with these other defendants in which Nokia bought out their patents. Apple claims that Nokia is attempting to monopolize the market by acquiring all of these patents as Nokia would then have enforcement rights over a bunch of patents that Apple thinks it shouldn't. Apple claims that these patents would restrict their market. In response, Nokia has filed a bunch of patent infringement cases against Apple, which I will not get to as their are quite a few. Just know that Nokia is counter suing. 









On January 12, 2017, the Court gave the defendants until March 28th to respond to Apples complaint. None have done so thus far. My take on this whole thing, is that one of two things will happen. First, this case may go all the way through discovery (the evidence stages of the proceedings) and the court will make a ruling as to any remaining counts against Nokia--this would probably take a couple of years. Second, and what I think is more likely, is that Apple and Nokia will eventually settle to squash all of this beef. Last time they settled, Nokia ended up receiving ~$700M. If this were to settle, Nokia may agree to license patents to Apple in exchange for some $$$. I really don't see Nokia paying apple any money unless the the Court itself makes a ruling.

Is the workout at home trade done? Intel stops the bleeding while Apple loses lawsuit. Let<U+0092>s talk about this and other stock market news**









Hello everyone and Good Morning! So, let<U+0092>s start with the recap of yesterday, as we saw all 3 big indexes closing the day in the red despite hitting intraday records, with the [NASDAQ COMPOSITE](https://ibb.co/PCN8dwz) losing .38%, while both the broad market [SP500](https://ibb.co/cDjpNKP) and the [DOW JONES](https://ibb.co/RydQj61) Industrial finished the day down just over .2% as we also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/44wGzR0) rising by more than 4% yesterday as the $2000 stimulus was [BLOCKED](https://ibb.co/WFNSpCH) in the Senate by McConnell and the Georgia Senate runoff election is just a week away.









Almost 70% of the [COMPANIES](https://ibb.co/LYM4JfL) were declining yesterday on below average volume as the number of companies that were trading above the 50-day moving average fell under 70% for the first time in quite a while.









We saw 9 of the 11 [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/GRJSmht) closing in the red yesterday, with only the Health Care and Consumer Discretionary sectors having small gains as almost all the types of companies were losing ground [YESTERDAY](https://ibb.co/7tKPyP4), especially the small-caps with the small-cap growth group losing more than 2%.









Here is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/KjVsn9X) from yesterday, it<U+0092>s mostly red, with only a couple of companies that were gaining big like the Chinese companies alongside Amazon and Intel.HEAT









We also got some economic data yesterday, as a review of the 2020 aviation and air travel [ESTIMATED](https://ibb.co/hRbYxpG) that traffic will be down 67% since last year, dropping to levels not seen since 1999, as air travel is still struggling to come back after the march bottoms. This has affected most of the [COMPANIES](https://ibb.co/FBq4g37) worldwide but it seems that China airlines is doing somewhat better with the biggest percentage of the total number of flights completed compared to last year.









The SP Home price [INDICES](https://ibb.co/W67RBYh) also came in better than expected with the National Index increasing by 1.4% M/M, as this is a leading measure of real estate prices, gaining 8.4% nationwide over year ago.









These moves can also be seen in the latest Redfin report, as home sales [PRICES](https://ibb.co/CwR5H56) are up 14% year/year to over $320K with a great increase in pending [SALES](https://ibb.co/mJtrwV9) which are also up more than 34% since last year, as the number of active [LISTINGS](https://ibb.co/vVkfMMh) of home sales is down more than 30%, as buyers can<U+0092>t snatch them up quick enough with such low [YIELDS](https://ibb.co/7j1kY3s), as this has led for the [AVERAGE](https://ibb.co/gzQq8Wb) sale price to list value to rise to 99.4% which Is up 1.5% since 2019. This should be good news for companies like Toll Brothers, Lennar, HD and LOW.









This was also accompanied by the great numbers in the us chain store sales [NUMBERS](https://ibb.co/4PykPcH), which rose by almost 9% y/y with December sales expected to rise almost 5% since last year and a .2% increase since last month.









While [TODAY](https://ibb.co/8N3YMPV) we start the day with MBA Mortgage applications, home sales and the Chicago PMI alongside advance reads on many other data points.









In some other stock market [NEWS](https://ibb.co/q1J6Snv), we saw Apple cool of a little yesterday, losing more than 1% for the day while they also lost a lawsuit aimed of stopping Corellium using virtual iPhone for security researching in the operating system, while [INTEL](https://ibb.co/3vvXFGT) finally got a breather and recovered some of the recent loses, after an activist hedge fund manager pushed for strategic changes in the company as Intel is losing market share and top designers, with the company also [ISSUING](https://ibb.co/WgtwTrY) a statement that lifted spirits around the stock.









We also saw the [FAA](https://ibb.co/6rJ6bHd) introduce new rules for drones, this may have a big impact on companies like UPS, Walmart and Amazon, as all of them have started trials for drone-delivery, as this could lead to better margins for the companies.









The Fed also [EXTENDED](https://ibb.co/cxV3HkC) the main street lending programs until Jan. 8 with the approval of Mnuchin as they try to process a bunch of applications this month, this means we can get even more money put into the economy and eventually the stock markets which is good news.









And meanwhile, AstraZeneca<U+0092>s vaccine was [APPROVED](https://ibb.co/y5QWbmh) for emergency use in the UK, this is another weapon to find this freaking illness, while JNJ will give us some results in early 2021 and Novavax just started their trial in the US.









Also, one last piece of data that I found recently shows that there was indeed a huge spike this [YEAR](https://ibb.co/JrKw01B) in the move to live streaming video and pre-recorded videos this year, as this has boosted companies like Peloton, Lululemon and others.









But this trend is seen slowing down in the next years with just a 4% [CAGR](https://ibb.co/HGhFJXS) in the equipment market, but that the exercise apps will see a big [GROWTH](https://ibb.co/02wm273) in the next years, so there are 2 different POV.

But don<U+0092>t rush into companies like which have diluted their stock a lot or have lots of debt<U+0085> this will not recover so fast...

For the past year Apple has been on a massive run with seemingly no sign of stopping. Analysts have been upping their price targets and managers who have missed out on the run are piling in. With Apple recently reporting earnings, there has been renewed debate about what price investors should be paying for stock in Apple. Many say that the company is expensive and point to relative valuation measures such as P/E that are above their long term averages. Others say the company is inexpensive and point to growing revenue segments such as wearables and services.









My preferred method of valuing companies is intrinsic valuation, and what I present here is an intrinsic valuation assessing the value of equity in Apple using a DCF model. I am hoping to start a discussion about what others believe that Apple stock is worth, as well as what assumptions I have made that others agree or disagree with.









I present a base case, bull case, and bear case for Apple and what each of those scenarios would potentially look like. If I was an analyst I would give the stock a buy rating and place the fair value range of Apple stock between $350 and $400.

The firm added Apple to its ""best ideas"" list on Wednesday, praising the company's blowout December-quarter results and growth in Asia. After exceeding expectations for iPhone 12 sales, the iPhone 13 could be a ""game-changer"" that extends the upgrade ""supercycle"" for another year, Ives said.









""The recent sell-off creates a golden buying opportunity with a $3 trillion valuation on the horizon for Cupertino in our opinion,"" he added.









Wedbush reiterated its ""outperform"" rating with a $175 price target. The firm also holds a bull-case target of $225, which implies an 86% surge from Tuesday's closing level.









Wall Street expects Apple to ship roughly 220 million iPhones in the current fiscal year. Ives holds a considerably rosier outlook, instead projecting sales can rise to a record 250 million.









The bullish estimate is partially fueled by expectations for millions of current iPhone owners to upgrade their phones throughout the year. Some 350 million of the 950 million iPhones worldwide are due for an upgrade, according to Wedbush. The dynamic stands to prop up demand into the fall, Ives said.









The upgrade supercycle could even last through 2022 if iPhone 13 rumors prove true, the analyst added. Supply chain reports signal Apple initially aims to build 100 million units of the upcoming model, up from 80 million for the iPhone 12 lineup.









While this number is subject to change, the reports hint at ""an increased confidence with Cook &amp; Co. that this 5G product cycle"" will continue into next year, Ives said.









Apple closed at $121.08 on Tuesday, down 9.4% year-to-date. The company has 81 ""buy"" ratings, 15 ""hold"" ratings, and three ""sell"" ratings from analysts.","Apple is a 'best idea' pick that can rally up to 86% as tech stocks rebound, Wedbush says $AAPL: * **Wedbush named Apple one of its ""best ideas"" stocks after recent selling set up a ""great entry point.""**

The tech stocks that led the market higher in 2020 are faring worse this year. Wedbush sees it as a perfect opportunity to scoop up the group's biggest name.









Investors gearing up for a swift economic rebound have recently dumped growth stocks for riskier plays. The broad rotation to value stocks has dragged on tech mega-caps and sparked wild shifts between heavy selling and sudden dip-buying. While the Nasdaq composite notched a massive 3.7% gain on Tuesday, the biggest tech stocks still boast year-to-date losses.

I've made out pretty nicely on AMD so far, having bought in at 9.5 and again at 11.5. It looks like we're hitting another resistance point and I'm considering cashing in and going long on AAPL. Part of my thinking is that, despite it being at something like a two year high, this is the year Apple's due to release some riskier, more exciting products (rather than further iterations of their core), so I can imagine some potential big games, but with their core products, not much risk for loss. On top of that... dividends. Which are always nice.

I just wanted to make sure it was detailed and explained everything as I'm sure this sub has been riddled with posts identical to this recently.









So to start this off I'll admit that I dived straight in with no prior knowledge of investing with GME, AMC and the most stupid, a little bit of Dogecoin. I'm still hoping AMC will recover at least a little when theatres re-open as I bought at $15 lol. I sold half my $400 GME off early (bought at $320) for about $10 profit or something tiny. I still have $200 and I'm still holding on. I'm aware that this might not be wise but luckily, the one non-stupid thing I did with this is that I used a certain percentage of my profits from beermoney ventures (surveys, market research and the like) as well as my matched betting which means, that whilst it was stupid and it is frustrating to lose both my own money and potential profit due to my own lack of research, I haven't risked anything I couldn't afford to lose.









I'm getting older and busier so I don't always have time to be answering long and boring surveys anymore so I wanted to take the percentage of these profits and invest in relatively long term stocks. I've been doing some research and have purchased a couple of books and I've been looking into a variety of different stocks to start my portfolio. It's worth mentioning that I only have roughly $400-$500 to invest.









These are the shares I'm thinking/have already invested in:









**NVAX:**









Currently, I have $50 that I got at $211.91 a share in NVAX. For those who don't know NVAX recently developed a Coronavirus vaccine that is 89% effective, whilst this is less than Pfizer and Moderna, Pfizer and Moderna are not backed up by clinical trials and most importantly, NVAX was 89% effective against both the original and the new mutated Coronavirus. I think this will do quite well.














**AAPL:**









This is where the stocks I have end. AAPL is currenly at $135 which seems quite low and despite COVID, it has done really well financially. There is also mentioning of the Apple Car, Apple VR a new computer and it's increase in iPhone users this/last year. It seems like an obvious purchase but this is definitely where my lack of knowledge comes in. There have been all this stuff, huge revenues, new products and it's debt deal, yet over the past few days it's kinda stayed between $130 - $140 so I'm a bit uncertain on this one.









**FUBO:**









This seems like it could do very well and there's loose speculation of it being worth $200 by the end of the year. That being said, the subscription revenue isn't particularly long-term, but then, they do have a new betting service. They report earnings on March 2. I was thinking of putting in a sell order at around at some price between $40-$50 but I'm very clearly not an expert so was hoping someone might have better insight. I'm thinking that personally, this is too risky for me either way but would be nice to hear some insight so I can learn what to look out for.









**SQ**:









There was a bit of a dip in Square. They seem to be fundamentally quite strong since they cater to non-cash payments and for obvious reasons right now that seems pretty good. I think more importantly though, I don't want to go on about it but obviously a certain couple apps are in trouble and since CashApp now offers investing for a very similar user base it might increase. Like Apple this one seems obvious but then it's currently at $227. A optimistic look from investopedia says it'll go back up to $300. I assume there's a bit of a risk with that so with the risk and the fact that the optimistic increase would be from \~$230 to $300 I feel that now I might be a bit late.









This is the end of a very long post and thanks for reading it. I understand that it's impossible to say you should go with this stock as it's 100% going to profit but I think some tips with these stocks that I mentioned and I guess just general advice for things to look for that I may have missed in my small analyses. I find that for some reason, I'm always reluctant to invest in the big'uns like Tesla, Apple, Facebook, Microsoft as in my head they're just expensive shares that don't change much which is obviously untrue and probably a mindset of an inexperienced investor. Also, I'm aware that even over the span of a few years <U+00A3>400 might not necessarily make me lots but I'm using this time to come to grips with it more so that when I have a bigger income I'm more experienced. Also, I feel it's worth adding that I am a computer science and electronics student and I imagine investing in things you know/are interested in is always a good thing but I don't really know how to start with just finding a good company to invest in that isn't at least being mentioned a little.

Them releasing a ""budget"" smartphone was also probably a good idea on their part since all of their other phones cost way too much money for what you're getting for them.









On the other hand, Apple Watch sales have apparently plummeted as of April, even though theyre outselling most other smartwatches. I just don't think people are into the whole smartwatch idea yet, sounds pretty fucking dumb if you ask me.

* Stock is nearing $100, where it has massive resistance. It's not likely to convincingly break this resistance leading up to earnings. Again, what has the company accomplished in the last quarter?_x000D__x000D__x000D__x000D__x000D_
* Last time leading up to earnings, AAPL stock hit a multi-month high, and then started trending steadily downwards. This info, combined with the above, leads me to believe the stock may start trending downwards._x000D__x000D__x000D__x000D__x000D_

* I just can't imagine what good news could come from the earnings report. What revelutionary plan will AAPL present for continuing its growth and expanding its client base? The only thing I can think of is announcing they will be acquiring some business or another, which would still send its share price down._x000D__x000D__x000D__x000D__x000D_

**An update from IG Group CEO June Felix**



**Dear Retard**



We are in the midst of an unfolding situation in global markets which is attracting a significant number of new traders to trading platforms to buy particular stocks in a coordinated way.



This has caused a significant increase in trading volumes and demands on our platform. As a result of this some clients have experienced disruption to service. This has fallen short of the high standards we set ourselves and the service you deserve. For those clients who have experienced disruption, I would like to offer you my sincere apologies, and assure you we are addressing these issues as a matter of urgency.



We took a number of steps immediately and continue to implement additional measures to avoid any further disruption:



1.Our teams are working around the clock to improve the resilience, login and trading capacity of the platform2.We have significantly increased the number of support staff available to assist you, with 24-hour support available at [helpdesk.uk@ig.com](mailto:helpdesk.uk@ig.com). If you have emailed the helpdesk we will get back to you.3.We have temporarily paused new account opening so that we can focus on providing our existing clients with the service they deserve.



**We have also made the difficult decision to temporarily suspend new trading on GameStop and AMC Entertainment**. We fundamentally believe in empowering our clients and enabling them to trade what they want, when they want, how they want. This decision has been entirely motivated by our desire to ensure our platform and services remain fully operational for existing clients, as we prioritise giving you the best service we can.



We will continue to closely monitor this quickly evolving situation. We will bring in additional measures if necessary and seek to remove any trading restrictions as soon as possible.



I thank you for your patience.

Aright retards, listen up:_x000D__x000D__x000D__x000D_
_x000D__x000D__x000D__x000D_
The key thing we don't know right now is what the **real** short interest is sitting at for GME._x000D__x000D__x000D__x000D_
_x000D__x000D__x000D__x000D_
But let's give them the benefit of the doubt and say that the S3 numbers are right. The VW squeeze happened with less than half of the current SI GME has. For this squeeze to happen we need big players to start covering._x000D__x000D__x000D__x000D_
_x000D__x000D__x000D__x000D_

_x000D__x000D__x000D__x000D_
And if they are still there, for 13 consecutive days, and the SEC doesn't do shit (not surprising) we will have to file thousands of complaints to them, call congressmen and senators, etc. to make sure the government steps in and forces them to cover._x000D__x000D__x000D__x000D_

Either the SEC will do their job and if GME keeps trading anywhere near its current price in two days big players will be forced to cover and the squeeze will (must) happen.

The key thing we don't know right now is what the **real** short interest is sitting at for GME._x000D__x000D__x000D__x000D_
_x000D__x000D__x000D__x000D_
But let's give them the benefit of the doubt and say that the S3 numbers are right. The VW squeeze happened with less than half of the current SI GME has. For this squeeze to happen we need big players to start covering._x000D__x000D__x000D__x000D_
_x000D__x000D__x000D__x000D_
The SEC (though they do nothing most of the time) is *supposed to* force any HF shorting GME to cover, if we can continue to keep GME on this list for the next two days:_x000D__x000D__x000D__x000D_

_x000D__x000D__x000D__x000D_
And if they are still there, for 13 consecutive days, and the SEC doesn't do shit (not surprising) we will have to file thousands of complaints to them, call congressmen and senators, etc. to make sure the government steps in and forces them to cover._x000D__x000D__x000D__x000D_

**TLDR:**_x000D__x000D__x000D__x000D_
_x000D__x000D__x000D__x000D_
Either the SEC will do their job and if GME keeps trading anywhere near its current price in two days big players will be forced to cover and the squeeze will (must) happen. Or we complain to the SEC to try and make them enforce their own regulation. ([https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm))_x000D__x000D__x000D__x000D_

Edit: The only thing we must take into account is that the HFs have probably already seen this coming. This means they might have tried every way possible to get out of it... I'm just not sure how, yet. See this post covering this exact issue but 28 days ago...

 Today, these stupid little shit fuckers really decided to show us their entire hand. They used the same short attack that they used previously, but not only did they do it so blatantly obvious, they did it across our beloved GME and AMC (THESE ARE THE ONLY PLAYS THAT MATTER, THEY DID IT ELSEWHERE TOO). This was the most obvious share-shake attempt that I've ever seen, and it was done more outwardly than the previous attempt. **THEY'RE SCARED, WE HAVE TO BE CLOSE TO INITIATING PHASE 1 OF THE MOASS.** As GME and AMC keep rising, they have to keep buying more and more shares to lose less money on the options that are ITM or will be ITM by the end of the week. They extra fucked themselves today with their bullshit attack. **They triggered the short sale restriction** meaning that tomorrow (for GME), they won't be able to orchestrate such a massive attack because they'll only be able to short shares during upticks; *but ape say ""if big back fat crying down his back Melvin just short on uptick won't it crash?""* **NO, BECAUSE GME UPTICKS EVERY .6969696996420 MILLISECONDS.** ***Tomorrow we will be able to BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY*** and these chicken shits won't be able to shake the shares out of the paper handed bitches as easily as they had today.

Again, heres the direct comparison_x000D__x000D__x000D__x000D_

_x000D__x000D__x000D__x000D_
The combination of 97-117% short interest as a percent of the float + the float being extremely small at only 900K means there is MASSIVE potential here for an epic short squeeze, hence my price target of $21 (300% increase from the current price of $7)._x000D__x000D__x000D__x000D_

# Bull Case_x000D__x000D__x000D__x000D_
_x000D__x000D__x000D__x000D_
* STRONG FINANCIAL POSITION - GameStop has non-trivial cash flow ($8B revenue and $232M free cash flow in 2019), $500 million in cash, and manageable debt. Recent share price increase also opens up the option to raise more cash through equity offerings._x000D__x000D__x000D__x000D_
* ACTIVIST INVESTOR RYAN COHEN - Activist investor Ryan Cohen is campaigning to focus the company on ecommerce instead of brick-and-mortar retail. Stocks tend to do well if a company is targetted by activist investors and Cohen is the perfect activist investor to drive change at GameStop given his experience running Chewy, an online retailer for pet products. Cohen and two former Chewy execs were recently appointed to GameStop's board._x000D__x000D__x000D__x000D_
* LEVERAGE EXISTING ONLINE FOOTPRINT - GameStop can leverage its existing online footprint (GameStop.com and GameInformer.com) as a low cost starting point to grow its ecommerce business._x000D__x000D__x000D__x000D_
* 5,000 BRICK-AND-MORTAR STORES FOR OMNICHANNEL RETAIL - GameStop's 5,000 brick-and-mortar stores is unintuitively an asset for its ecommerce pivot. Market research shows that omnichannel retail strategies perform better than purely-online strategies (e.g. Apple and its iconic Apple Stores). The real-life experience of physical stores increases customer spending and brand loyalty. GameStop's focus on gaming and its many physical stores give it an omnichannel edge over other gaming ecommerce retailers. For example, its stores can be optimized for gaming experiences while Walmart and Best Buy don't have room to be specific._x000D__x000D__x000D__x000D_
* OPPORTUNITY TO CUT FAT - GameStop's stores have short term leases (24 months average lease duration) which gives it opportunities to cut fat by closing underperforming stores._x000D__x000D__x000D__x000D_
* LARGE LOYALTY PROGRAM - GameStop's PowerUp loyalty program has 55 million members that are, or can be converted, to dedicated ecommerce customers._x000D__x000D__x000D__x000D_
* LOW PRICE TO SALES RATIO - Even with a $2.5 billion market cap ($35.5 per share), GameStop has a relatively low price-to-sales (PS) ratio of 0.4. The SP500's median PS ratio is 1.5. Chewy, the company co-founded by Ryan Cohen, trades at over 6 times sales. Even with just a PS ratio of 1, GME's price would be around $90._x000D__x000D__x000D__x000D_
* GAMING INDUSTRY GROWING RAPIDLY - The gaming industry has been growing rapidly over the last few years and GameStop is in a great position to capitalize on this growth if management can successfully pivot the company._x000D__x000D__x000D__x000D_
* INVESTOR MINDSHARE - GME's explosive move last week caught everyone off guard and now everyone's talking/thinking about it (especially Jim Cramer). With so many people watching the stock, expect any modicum of good news to propel the stock upwards._x000D__x000D__x000D__x000D_
* SHORT SQUEEZE - A short squeeze can happen when many short positions are forced to close at once when the short stock's price increases rapidly. This creates a temporary burst in buying pressure that can rapidly increase a stock's price in the short term. GME is a heavily shorted stock and is at high risk of short squeezes._x000D__x000D__x000D__x000D_

* FAILURE TO PIVOT - GameStop's biggest risk is a failure to pivot to an omnichannel ecommerce business. To reach this goal, the company has significant hurdles to clear. For one, there are many competitors in the gaming ecommerce space. Walmart, Amazon, and Best Buy compete with GameStop in selling physical gaming products like consoles and accessories. If GameStop starts to sell digital goods like downloadable games, it'll face intense competition from Steam, EA's Origin, and Microsoft's Xbox Game pass, as examples. To succeed in this hyper competitive space, GameStop needs to find a niche and grow from there. This is a difficult journey requiring business acumen, finesse, and dedication from its executive team._x000D__x000D__x000D__x000D_
* UNFAVORABLE BROADER MARKET CONDITIONS - GME is a speculative stock and speculative stocks are the hardest-hit during a market downturn. Economic conditions remain uncertain with the slow rollout of the vaccines, the fact that we don't know how _practically_ effective the vaccines are, the apperance of multiple COVID-19 strains around the world, and the likely resumption of debt payments this year (e.g. end of the student loan moratorium in May and the end of the eviction moratorium in February). The chances of a market downturn in 2021 is non-trivial. In addition, even if the pandemic does end and North America and Europe opens up again, expect a short term decline in gaming interest as everyone rushes to go back outside. This can negatively impact GameStop's earnings for a couple of quarters._x000D__x000D__x000D__x000D_

GME has been a red hot stock in the past few months and last week's giant push to almost $40 will be followed by a period of consolidation as bulls take profit and bears place shorts. During this time, the stock will trade sideways or downwards._x000D__x000D__x000D__x000D_
_x000D__x000D__x000D__x000D_
If you're a GME bull and hold shares, consider selling out-of-the-money covered calls during the consolidation period. Adventurous investors could even sell at any price above $37.5 and re-enter at a lower support level (e.g. $33)._x000D__x000D__x000D__x000D_
_x000D__x000D__x000D__x000D_
If you're a GME bull but don't hold shares, you should wait for price to consolidate to a lower support level before buying in. Selling out-of-the-money puts is a good way to get paid while waiting._x000D__x000D__x000D__x000D_
_x000D__x000D__x000D__x000D_
If you are a GME bear, I don't recommend shorting the stock. Stocks with so much retail investor fervor can skyrocket to astronomical prices before settling back down to reason._x000D__x000D__x000D__x000D_
_x000D__x000D__x000D__x000D_
The next few quarters are key for GameStop's transformation. During this time, any positive news is a strong price catalyst. I'm most interested in what changes will come from Ryan Cohen now that he has board representation. For example, it'll be very bullish if the current CEO, George Sherman, is replaced. Sherman is a brick-and-mortar retail veteran and not the best CEO to change GameStop into an ecommerce giant. I won't be surprised if Sherman stepping down is a similar event to Intel CEO Bob Swan's resignation announcement, which caused Intel's stock price to jump by more than 10%._x000D__x000D__x000D__x000D_

On Dec 8th, GME reported Q3 earnings, it spiked as soon as algos got wind they beat earnings but then sold off HARD from 18$ to 12.2$ after 2-3 days. This is straight up market manipulation, tank the stock so people think its bearish news. Someone bought a fuck ton of puts and tanked the stock as GME was then put on the NYSE Threshold Securities List (any stocks naked shorted are listed here). Market Makers had to hedge those puts by shorting GME, this is legal as they facilitate liquidity to the market._x000D__x000D__x000D__x000D_

Ryan Cohen's big buy prevented the stock from going lower as he bought another 3% of the company and climbed higher blowing past 20$. _x000D__x000D__x000D__x000D_
_x000D__x000D__x000D__x000D_
On Jan 11, this was the day ICR where GME will lay out their plans but news came out that RC and gang joined the board and presentation was pulled, now I bet you that those  🌈🐻 was prepared to do the same thing and tank the stock when they presented. What does this mean? [Well based on this](https://preview.redd.it/xquiruns9yc61.jpg?width=7659&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0d6d13ea9895a57c80ced0e43c6ebd00b702834c) we can see that SI spiked up. Someone caught wind of this and bought up the calls and ran up the stock price on GME. Someone was buying before causing the gamma squeeze that occurred. _x000D__x000D__x000D__x000D_
_x000D__x000D__x000D__x000D_
We will see this on Jan 27th when they publish the SI for the week of Jan 1-15 that SI most likely spiked up hard. Keep your eyes peeled. _x000D__x000D__x000D__x000D_
_x000D__x000D__x000D__x000D_
These 🌈🐻are trying to fuck with you. Any news that comes out they just buy a fuck ton of puts to force MM to naked short since there are no more shares to short so people correlate a sell in the stock as bad news._x000D__x000D__x000D__x000D_

_x000D__x000D__x000D__x000D_
First, MRO's market cap is $6.02 billion, but its net assets are $10.89 billion. This means that MRO should be trading AT LEAST at $14.93. This is why most analysts like Morningstar or raise its evaluation to $11 or $13, but I think they're being too conservative with its valuation. _x000D__x000D__x000D__x000D_
_x000D__x000D__x000D__x000D_
For one, MRO revenue in September increased 177% from the previous quarter while costs were about the same. The price of oil from March to June was about $30 while from June to Sept it stayed around $40. With just a $10 change in the price of oil, MRO was able to more than double its revenue. With oil prices nearing $50 now, it's very likely MRO will post a profit in Q4 2020._x000D__x000D__x000D__x000D_
_x000D__x000D__x000D__x000D_
Once they post a profit, MRO will return back to its true value of $10.89 billion meaning the price will SPIKE to $14.93. IMO the big funds have it WRONG because $11-$13 is undervaluing MRO. Their evaluations also rely on the assumption that MRO will lose money throughout 2021. _x000D__x000D__x000D__x000D_

During that period Blue Apron's short interest was 50%.  Blue Apron was running out of cash and shorts piled on.  Then the pandemic happened an people started ordering meal kits en mass, infusing Blue Apron with large inflows of cash.  Fearing, meal kits had become a secular trend like ride sharing, shorts started to cover.  But they soon discovered shares were limited.  So the infinite squeeze happened.  *They had to cover at any price to balance their books when Market makers started to sell off their other positions.*_x000D__x000D__x000D__x000D_

Currently GME Short Interest is rumored to be above 100% \[1\].  Thus the environment is similar to the Blue Appron infinite short squeeze.  Namely, there are no shares for GME shorts to cover, once the infinite squeeze occurs and MM forces them to balance their books._x000D__x000D__x000D__x000D_

Moreover, the squeeze hasn't happened yet, given that the Short Interest hasn't moved lower.

# Behaviour of an Infinite Short Squeeze_x000D__x000D__x000D__x000D_
_x000D__x000D__x000D__x000D_
The behaviour of an infinite short squeeze (ISS) are violent.  In financial history, the two widely cited cases are the VW infinite squeeze of '08 and the Blue Appron one of '20.  As you can see, infinite short squeezes have been rare because most rational agents would never get themselves into a situation which would lead to an ISS._x000D__x000D__x000D__x000D_
_x000D__x000D__x000D__x000D_
When shares can't be covered and stock price increases, shorts are forced to cover by Market Makers.  But because of the huge supply/demand imbalance, shorts have to cover at prices that would seem irrational on a cursory glance but are rational based on the supply/demand equilibrium of available shares.  ***Consequently, it is normal to see 1000% increases in one day.  And 100000% gains in 0dte options.***_x000D__x000D__x000D__x000D_
_x000D__x000D__x000D__x000D_
As more market player realize the infinite short squeeze is inevitable, the tripping point of the squeeze collapses from months to days to hours.   *The only way shorts can alleviate the narrative of inevitably is to spread fear, uncertainty and doubt (FUD).  So as long as GME stock positions are maintained, and more shares are bought, the short squeeze is inevitable.*_x000D__x000D__x000D__x000D_

This post will describe the behaviour of an infinite short squeeze using Blue Appron as a case study.  On March 16, 2020.  Blue Appron stock priced moved from 2.30 to 28.00 in ONE DAY.   ***That's an 1100% gain in one day with the stock price.  Options moved over 100000% that day.*** The reason was an infinite short squeeze similar to the one that is happening with GME._x000D__x000D__x000D__x000D_

During that period Blue Apron's short interest was 50%.  Blue Apron was running out of cash and shorts piled on.  Then the pandemic happened an people started ordering meal kits en mass, infusing Blue Apron with large inflows of cash.  Fearing, meal kits had become a secular trend like ride sharing, shorts started to cover.  But they soon discovered shares were limited.  So the infinite squeeze happened.  *They had to cover at any price to balance their books when Market makers started to sell off their other positions.*_x000D__x000D__x000D__x000D_

Currently GME Short Interest is rumored to be above 100% \[1\].  Thus the environment is similar to the Blue Appron infinite short squeeze.  Namely, there are no shares for GME shorts to cover, once the infinite squeeze occurs and MM forces them to balance their books._x000D__x000D__x000D__x000D_
_x000D__x000D__x000D__x000D_
Moreover, the squeeze hasn't happened yet, given that the Short Interest hasn't moved lower.  In fact, it has been rumored short interest has increased as shorts make a last ditch effort to scare off the bulls.  But the markets is aware how the conditions are there for an infinite short squeeze._x000D__x000D__x000D__x000D_

**Round 2**: Ding, ding, ding. Here's my previous [analysis](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lspbb5/gme_dd_analysis_of_options_expiry_on_226_and/)

**TL;DR**: The data indicates that squeezes could be on the way.







---



**Analysis**







Currently: Roughly $227m in value, or 11.6m shares, (call-put) are in the money. 







* At each $10 threshold up to $150/share, approximately 1m shares come into the money at each increment. 



* At $160/share, approximately 2m shares come into the money.







&amp;nbsp;







Since rate of delta change is the highest around each strike price (meaning gamma is also largest). It would lead me to believe that a ton of shares will need to be bought to hedge these positions as these share price amounts are passed (creating a sequence of gamma squeezes).







&amp;nbsp;







**If price were to squeeze up to $810/share (~56b market cap): 







* The net calls in the money would exceed the float.** This is insane! Even if calls were covered on the way up by buying the underlying, it's not possible to cover more than 100% of float



* 8m shares would come into the money creating a huge gamma squeeze



* This in turn would create a massive short squeeze (even if current short reporting is accurate, which is somewhat questionable at this point, there are more net calls alone that need to be covered to exceed float, which means shorts would be squeezed not just because of the price, but also because of share lenders calling shares. P.S. - Not sure how this works, so would like to hear others weigh-in if they understand this better)



* Really, hitting this price seems like it would create a squeeze of epic proportions







&amp;nbsp;







As of 3/3 close: (Call Value ITM - Put Value ITM) = **&gt;$226m** | Call Shares ITM - Put Shares ITM = **&gt;11.5m**

* Really, hitting this price seems like it would create a squeeze of epic proportions

207,mgujym,GME,"What does accelerating GME to digital mean?: I'm curious what folks who are long GME think happens when Gamestop accelerates and goes 100% digital? Why do you think that is good for Gamestop? I have no position in Gamestop, either long or short. I'm just watching it all with fascination. I used to work at Activision Blizzard, where their big game is Call of Duty. You know how much money Gamestop makes on a digital download of COD? Zero. Not even 1 penny. Activision has to pay Sony a 30% platform fee, for the privilege of selling Call of Duty on the Playstation store. Because Sony made the hardware, and got all the customers to buy the hardware, video game publishers have to pay a platform fee in order to publish their video game onto their digital store, ie, the Playstation store on the PS4 or PS5. Same with Microsoft. Activision, and other video game publishers, have to also pay a 30% platform fee to MSFT for users to digitally download their game. Gamestop gets zero from that digital download, either with Sony or MSFT. So, if Ryan Cohen is able to digitally transform GME into a digital powerhouse, and let's say all video games go digital, GME will make nothing from digitally downloaded games. Gamestop makes money from selling physical games, hardware consoles, game controllers, accessories, maybe some funko pops, buying and selling used physical games. But on a digital download...they don't make any money from that. Back at the end of 2019, GME management pitched Activision, and they wanted a slice of our digital download revenues. They explained it as, ""Look, we have millions of customers, we have their data, we know their address and emails...we can leverage that to help Activision make more money. So...we want a slice of your digital download business."" When my team heard about this, (we were in a conference room, waiting for a meeting to start), first, we all started laughing. After about 5 minutes of laughing and making jokes, we got serious. Why would we give any our of revenues to GME? We don't need to do that. They weren't clear on how they could leverage the customer data to our benefit. Someone made a good point: would GME give us a slice of their used physical game business? Because that is huge margins for GME. They buy your used physical game for like $5 or $10, and put it on the shelf as a used game for like $20 or $25. Great margins! Would they give us a piece of their used game business? No way. They don't need Activision to do their used game business, why should they give us any of that revenue? Same for digital. We don't need GME to sell digitally, and, we already pay a 30% platform fee to Sony and MSFT, why would we give GME a piece of the digital rev? So, I don't understand how Cohen will transform GME. If you agree that physical games are going away, and digital and streaming is the future...then GME is a dinosaur. I don't see it succeeding, but I could be wrong. Think of this. GME just posted their 9th straight declining quarter of revenues. In a COVID year where people are home, you have their undivided attention, AND new hardware launch of PS5 and new XBOX, they still posted declining rev. When new consoles come out, once every 8 years or so, you should be posting huge revenue increases, not decreases. They still went down in rev. This upcoming Xmas, with no new hardware launch that I'm aware of, I can't see their rev's going up. What am I missing?","What does accelerating GME to digital mean?: I'm curious what folks who are long GME think happens when Gamestop accelerates and goes 100% digital? Why do you think that is good for Gamestop? I have no position in Gamestop, either long or short. I'm just watching it all with fascination. I used to work at Activision Blizzard, where their big game is Call of Duty. You know how much money Gamestop makes on a digital download of COD? Zero. Not even 1 penny. Activision has to pay Sony a 30% platform fee, for the privilege of selling Call of Duty on the Playstation store. Because Sony made the hardware, and got all the customers to buy the hardware, video game publishers have to pay a platform fee in order to publish their video game onto their digital store, ie, the Playstation store on the PS4 or PS5. Same with Microsoft. Activision, and other video game publishers, have to also pay a 30% platform fee to MSFT for users to digitally download their game. Gamestop gets zero from that digital download, either with Sony or MSFT. So, if Ryan Cohen is able to digitally transform GME into a digital powerhouse, and let's say all video games go digital, GME will make nothing from digitally downloaded games. Gamestop makes money from selling physical games, hardware consoles, game controllers, accessories, maybe some funko pops, buying and selling used physical games. But on a digital download...they don't make any money from that. Back at the end of 2019, GME management pitched Activision, and they wanted a slice of our digital download revenues. They explained it as, ""Look, we have millions of customers, we have their data, we know their address and emails...we can leverage that to help Activision make more money. So...we want a slice of your digital download business."" When my team heard about this, (we were in a conference room, waiting for a meeting to start), first, we all started laughing. After about 5 minutes of laughing and making jokes, we got serious. Why would we give any our of revenues to GME? We don't need to do that. They weren't clear on how they could leverage the customer data to our benefit. Someone made a good point: would GME give us a slice of their used physical game business?

Apes, not a lot of extra time to do this shit for you guys but here's a first attempt at trying to help you visualize FTDs based on EVERY ETF associated with GME (red) and NVAX (green) or BOTH (blue). The reason NVAX is included is because I went all fucking in on it before GME was a thing, but have been getting equally as fucked even though it is going to save the world after we're long gone on our way to the moon.







Just focus on the RED shit though, if you get easily confused. One image is YTD FTDs by ETFs associated with these two securities. Both are low float. Both were dead in the water about a year ago. Both are about to fuck shit up in a good way. I took the latest FTD data from Jan 2021-present from SEC and joined it up with Institutional investment data from Fintel. And look at this shit. A lot of focus has been on XRT for GME (and IBB/XBI for NVAX), but March is showing that they're moving around. ITOT between fucking BOTH (1.25mm) and DSI(1.69mm)?







Apes, you need to keep your eyes on more than one fucking ETF. And while GME is the most exploited, know you have brothers and sisters out there suffering from the same tactics and bullshit they're doing here.

Tesla starts deliveries of the Model Y in China. Lemonade drops after the latest Citron short opinion while Nikola &amp; GameStop shareholders jump ship. Let<U+0092>s talk about this and other stock market news**







Hello everyone and Good Morning! So, let<U+0092>s start with the recap of the last few days as I haven<U+0092>t made a post since Wednesday, as I was busy making a full stock analysis on Amazon which you can check by clicking [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kxurg0/amazon_stock_150_upside_amazon_stock_price_target/).







So, on Thursday we saw all 3 major indexes finish in the red, with the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/MPQ6PVW) losing .12%, the [DOW](https://ibb.co/GJf3qV9) dropping almost 70 points and the broad stock market [SP500](https://ibb.co/r51hS22) dropping below $3800 to finish the day, as the [VIX](https://ibb.co/sq1P6gm) rose again by almost 5%, though 70% of the companies were [advancing](https://ibb.co/yhsdpZD) on normal volumes with just 8 new lows, as 4 of the 11 [sectors](https://ibb.co/ZW0k1VD) finished in the green with Energy outperforming by quite some gap, while Technology was the biggest loser, as Large-Cap Growth companies were the [underperformers](https://ibb.co/jZW53gf), while small-caps shined, with all 3 segments gaining more than 2% for the day.







Here is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/hsmYfRz) from Thursday, with Amazon, Microsoft, Tesla, Netflix &amp; Facebook all losing more than 1%, while the biggest gainers were the Semiconductors, Alibaba and some companies from the Materials and Oil &amp; Gas Industry.







We also received the investor sentiment [survey](https://ibb.co/XZNYQHY), which for me came in better with a drop of almost 1% in bullish investors and 4% in neutral ones, as fear has reached almost 5% more investors in this past week, which is a good sign for opportunities in the stock market.







Meanwhile, Friday was even worse for the broad stock market, with the [SP500](https://ibb.co/Ms5m47G) losing .72% as the [DOW](https://ibb.co/dKc4ZV0) dropped 177 points while the tech heavy [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/MkcyrQV) was the biggest underperformer dropping below $13000, as the [VIX](https://ibb.co/RSGmvvN) continued to rise near the 25 level and even had a spike near the 26 level in the early morning, but overall finished the [week](https://ibb.co/SnvsgHc) down almost 3%.







We saw again 4 of the 11 [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/0GTqNZG) finish in the green, but this time Energy was the biggest underperformer, losing almost 4% and giving up some of the huge gains made up this week, while Real Estate was the only sector to post a gain of more than 1% and Communications continued to recover after a bad start to the week, as almost 70% of the companies were declining on [Friday](https://ibb.co/grwfwwM), with Large-Cap Growth Companies slightly recovering to finish the [week](https://ibb.co/vX2mxss) down only 1.2%







Here is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/GdWj575) from Friday, in which you can struggle to find some bright spots, with the gains being concentrated in the Health Care &amp; Real Estate sectors, while for the [WEEK](https://ibb.co/441kLYw), there is some more breadth with Energy, Banks and Semiconductors also posting some gains.







On Thursday we also saw [Powell](https://ibb.co/M7vznm4) reiterating the point that rates won<U+0092>t be raised unless inflation becomes a serious problem, as he believes there is still plenty of room in the labor markets until maximum employment is reached, with this point being sustained by the increase in initial jobless [CLAIMS](https://ibb.co/X5brzGZ) which jumped almost 200K, a lot worse than expected and the previous month, as continuing jobless claims also jumped by about the same to 5.27M, a big increase over last week.







Moving on, Friday we also received more economic data, with the January [Consumer](https://ibb.co/n38hy4w) sentiment coming in at 79.2 lower than expected and the previous read, as consumers have lost confidence both in the current conditions and in expectations.







We also saw the New York business [activity](https://ibb.co/92Rydt9) coming in at 3.5, worse than the 6 expected and the 4.9 in the previous month, with new orders seeing an increase but being offset by a huge drop in shipments.







Business [Inventories](https://ibb.co/TRs2SMW) came in as expected at a .5% increase M/M, while Producer [prices](https://ibb.co/py4bpTn) rose less than expected and retail [sales](https://ibb.co/X2v2Y0Z) fell more than expected with a .7% decrease M/M.







This [WEEK](https://ibb.co/VqGMnJT) we start of slow, with no big data coming in until Thursday as we await the Biden inauguration tomorrow while the most interesting [earnings](https://ibb.co/B2T64dc) for me are Goldman Sachs as a continued read on how the banks are doing after last weeks good numbers, Netflix to see how the stay-at-home stocks will continue to perform and Intel to see how they manage to turn around things.







In some other stock market news, we saw [Aphria](https://ibb.co/nwxNpm0) beat consensus in earnings and starting a broad rally in pot stocks, while [Lemonade](https://ibb.co/vw4dXQ7) dropped more than 9% after CITRON went at them again, implying a drop back to under 100$ expected very soon.







We also saw IPOs soar again in the first trading day, with [PETCO](https://ibb.co/KwTHrvY) popping almost 50% and [POSHMARK](https://ibb.co/3cGk45W) more than doubling before dropping 20% as this IPOs are way overbought on every single launch just like most of the SPACs, with [Churchill](https://ibb.co/6JGGKHP) Capital also climbing huge on reports of a Lucid Motors deal, but this is only speculation and could have massive downside if the deal doesn<U+0092>t go through.







Meanwhile, [Delta](https://ibb.co/FzGKp9C) Airlines reported Q4 earnings and hinted at a positive cash flow by late-spring or summer as they reduced the cash burn from $24M to $12M/ day in Q4, which helped most of the airlines rally.







Thursday was capped off my [Biden's](https://ibb.co/bzh0fsV) new relief package proposal that seems to be around $1.9T. This will serve probably as a start point of future negotiations. This package includes $400B in crisis aids including $20B for vaccines, $50B for testing, $30B for supplies and $140B targeted at helping schools reopen and stay open.







The plan also includes $1T in aids to individuals including $1400 stimulus checks and extending the unemployment benefits to $400/week through September, $30B in rental assistance and extending the federal moratorium on evictions and foreclosure through September and increasing the minimum wage to $15/hour.







Biden<U+0092>s propsal also includes the highly debated help for state &amp; local governments worth $350B &amp; $50B in small business grants and loans. 







This will probably serve as a starting point and I don<U+0092>t expect everything to pass even with the blue sweep. It<U+0092>s likely going to be less than $1.9T, and most of the debate will continue to happen on the state &amp; local help and is also likely to exclude things like increasing the minimum hourly wage, as this is not something temporary like most of the other costs and is likely to receive big roadblocks. This will likely be a short-term boost for the stock market, but the impacts of this in terms of inflation, debt and other economic factors are still unknown in the long-run.







And moving on, Friday we saw [Tesla's](https://ibb.co/Vqmf9Mm) forecasted deliveries increased to 1M cars by Wedbush who also raised their price target to $950 with a bull case of $1250, as the Tesla [Model Y](https://ibb.co/1Qws23d) has finally started deliveries in China and will be one of the biggest bets Tesla has made, as the affordable SUV demand is much higher than any of the other Tesla models, while in contrast [Nikola](https://ibb.co/r3dFQSk) seems to be having firms jumping board with an early investor recently selling over 7M shares. Some similar action was seen from the director of [GameStop](https://ibb.co/rvyQdvq) who sold 800K shares after the recent pop in the stock. This kind of companies provide high risk/high reward opportunities, but you should have a tight approach to them, you should take profits whenever you can and not risk losing your gains on these highly volatile stocks that don<U+0092>t have a good fundamental basis.







So, let<U+0092>s hope for a good day in the markets as the [WORLD](https://ibb.co/nr2Pw5W) markets seem to be pointing to a good day, as we await Biden<U+0092>s pick Janet Yellen<U+0092>s [remarks](https://ibb.co/bsjzK1b) on the proposed stimulus and the dollar while the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/S3cfpZq) are also pointing to a green open, with the Nasdaq leading the way.

1. At US, insider trading, stock manipulation and fraud are serious crimes. Simply receiving Good News from the insider of the company, buying that current companys<U+0092> stock leads to serious crimes. Market Manupulation? Thats also included. In Citadel's case, not only is it a stock manipulation, but it's also a fraud of millions of retail investors by manipulating stock prices using the information of the retail investors we learned as market makers.  











2. There are two main ways of responding to hedge funds' illegal practices. One is through the SEC, and the other is through the Southern District Attorney's Office in New York.  



First of all, considering the solution through SEC, I don't think it will be very effective. Because, according to the precedent so far, Citadel is unlikely to be afraid of fines even if the SEC finds illegalities, and Citadel already employs former SEC executives for lobbyists, so it's unclear whether the SEC will reach a proper conclusion.  











So the most effective solution in reality is to solve it through the Southern District Attorney's Office in New York. The New York Southern Federal Prosecutors' Office has jurisdiction over Wall Street and has long been known as the Wall Street Grim Reaper, which is where hedge funds fear the most. And as in the movie Villions, what hedge funds fear is going to jail, not at all afraid of paying fines.  











Therefore, many of GameStop's retail investers are suffering from Citadel's stock manipulation, insider trading and fraud crimes, so it is imperative that Citadel be investigated thoroughly and filed with the Southern District Attorney's Office for severe punishment. If millions of apes join forces, this could be a game changer. Normally, the Southern New York Attorney's Office is an elite course of many politically ambitious prosecutors, and if it investigates and punishes a case with millions of victims and a big social issue, it will help the prosecutor's political future, so it will be win-win for each other.  











Now collective intelligence is essential to end this illegality of Citadel. We all have to join forces. Nothing happens if you don't do what's necessary.","THINGS WE SHOULD DO [ GME STOP ]: THINGS WE SHOULD DO

It was all about retail contrarian investing &amp; taking unpopular sides of the trade. $GME $AMC $CLOV: This year will go down in history as the year when retail investors caused several short squeezes in the stock market. But it was never really about the short squeeze. Sure, the GameStop saga was very interesting and it was a case of a company<U+0092>s shares being shorted 140% or thereabout. The shorts deserved to get their shirts ripped off their backs. But even that was not primarily the story of squeezing the short sellers.







Short selling is legal and it happens every day the market is open. It even has lots of benefits that it provides to the market, such as uncovering fraud, popping bubbles, correcting valuations, etc. Some companies deserve to get shorted. Enron deserved to be shorted. WorldCom deserved to be shorted. Luckin Coffee deserved to be shorted.







In addition, short sellers create opportunities for long investors. Buying GME for $5 per share was a bargain thanks to short sellers. Buying AMC for $3 was a bargain thanks to short sellers. Buying CLOV for $6 is a bargain thanks to short sellers. This is how we have to look at it. Rationally.







But here<U+0092>s what really drove those prices: not short sellers covering, but retail investors buying. Every single major price increase was driven by massive retail *volume*. Sure, institutions and whales jumped on board, but retail investors *initiated* all of that.







That<U+0092>s the power we have. Truly. We can move markets. What if we actually looked for undervalued bargains and cemented our positions for years? That would be amazing. So my point is this: this isn<U+0092>t the year of hedge funds getting squeezed, per se, even though that was a part of it, surely.

Reasoning for Price Targets using comps:







BBY (Best Buy) currently trades at a market cap / revenue (12 months forward) of 26.25b / 47.45b = 0.55 price / sales.







Because:







1) GME uses a digital first, omni-channel approach







2) Will have positive free cash flows due to the high demand from XBOX/PS5







3) Has a digital revenue sharing agreement with $MSFT







4) Has data from 55 Power Up Rewards members they can sell and leverage for additional revenue streams







5) Has a new insider, our lord and savior, RC god bless, who took CHWY from ground up to now trade at a price to sales of well above 5







Then:







Taking a proprietary formula spoken to me in a dream by RC while Melvin was getting liquidated, I have arrived at a price / sales of 0.843 which is higher than best buy but much less than Chewy. Using analyst estimates for the 12 months forward revs (5.76b) and solving for share price, we get a fair value of  \~**69.69 per share**.

# The Great RobinHood Ass-Covering 







*(sources listed at bottom for images btw)*







**Pre-cursor Statements:**







* This is sort of a question + hypothetical + little tinfoilery so bear with me regarding RobinHood's ""f*ractional share*"" / ""p*artial stock*"" ownership investing tool (*I'm not sure what they call it*). 



* I'm also under the assumption a lot of you purchased these 'partial shares' in an attempt to get in with the GME move.







**The Hypothetical Rambling:**







So let's [look at how many institutions had stakes in GME](https://i.imgur.com/1DA71UK.png) prior to what will most likely go down in history as the most hilarious HF short-covering shitshow of all time. [Even looking through the alphabetical assortment of institutional ownership](https://i.imgur.com/lIfPwV5.png) I don't see anywhere that Robinhood owned GME prior to the reporting date of 12/31/2020. So how is Robinhood able to sell small partitions of an equity / stock without actually owning it? This questions is bugging me, especially [since they claim these fractional shares are pieces of actual whole shares](https://robinhood.com/us/en/support/articles/fractional-shares/). So if Robinhood is selling these fractional shares... wouldn't they have to initially own the whole share in order to partition this stock into sublet shares to sell on their platform?







Enter the tinfoil hypothetical - **Robinhood never actually bought the GME stock and just sold the partial shares to investors, effectively creating their own uncovered GME position.** You autists purchased so many GME fractional shares that Robinhood's risk assessment team had a stroke. Combined with the GME shares they handed over on margin, the fact multiple major short-positioned HFs were frantically covering their own ass, and how many ""*whole shares*"" were needed for covering all the sold ""*fractional shares*"", RobinHood had created themselves an environment in which they are getting fucked harder than a mollied-up Kimberly Guilfoyle at an RNC convention. Once the realization set in that RobinHood is potentially on the line for 1,000,000s of uncovered GME shares they had to do something.







Welcome to Thursday 01/28/2021 where Robinhood freezes the sales of GME, strips margin accounts of GME positions, and gets their hands dirty in price manipulation based on the fact they had control over a massive GME purchasing power group. My hypothesis is they used this time to cover their own asses and buy their own shares of GME to close out this magnificent fucking failure of their own investing platform. It's completely possible they are even the reason behind the +100% short interest because they were borrowing already short-sold shares from Citron to sell the margin account GME positions and fractional shares.







&amp;#x200B;







**TL;DR** \- Robinhood put themselves in their own short-sold position with GME with fractional shares, possibly margin sales as well, and they halted the GME stock on their platform so they themselves could cover.







This is just speculation and a thought, I'm curious if this holds any weight or could be a realistic situation. What are your thoughts?

290,l6zaly,GME,"Why GME is going to moon to the moon and you should hold: 
This is now my fourth attempt to try to post this.



Ok well now that I have your attention I want to point out a few things. 



Disclaimer: not financial advice, and I<U+0092>m long 130 GME shares 







1. There have been a lot of bot accounts here recently that have been pushing everything but GME to try to get you out of your positions and into something else anything else. 







They have been pushing things like AMC Nokia and BB. Ask yourself how much DD you have seen for these? Well the answer is almost zero(except for BB) these are being pumped for the sole focus of getting you out of your GME position. Although BB might be a solid long term play short term GME is still a once in a life time play that isn<U+0092>t close to over. 







2. For all the new people here we aren<U+0092>t short busters, we don<U+0092>t go around looking for high short interest to force shorts to cover. That<U+0092>s not how things work here and it will backfire. I don<U+0092>t know wether it<U+0092>s a result of greed or arrogance but we don<U+0092>t run the markets and we never will. If you try to get in a tug of war with a hedge fund they will kill your positions. Any who has been here longer than a month remembers a time where an MM fucked half the sub at once in the blink of an eye, or when PLTR 30 calls expired worthless.











3  Why is GME different? It<U+0092>s different because GME is a value play first short squeeze second. The price was being suppressed artificially by high short interest. The real value was some where closer to 4x it<U+0092>s 20$ valuation. If GME was actually going to go bankrupt shorts would have waited us out until we lost interest or GME declared bankruptcy. 











4 short interest is still high. Regardless of what the Fake News media is telling you short interest is still high. I imagine a lot of retail shorts have covered at this point or been margin called, but for every short that exits a new one enters its place. These companies are in so deep that they will be forced to cover eventually and when they do it will be violent. Trust me you will know when Melvin liquidates there position. If the price has gone up this much based off of no major shorts covering imagine what will happen when they all cover in a violent exit with everyone trying to leave first. 







5 GME board thinks this is still going up. Remember the 100 million $ share offering originally intended to fend off Cohen? Well that still on the table and they haven<U+0092>t used it yet. Management would try to use it as close to the top as possible to minimize dilution. The fact it has been used yet implies a heavy upside. 







6 why I am still bullish? I am still bullish because of all the Options expiring ITM on Friday and the subsequent Monday after. A large amount of calls will expire on Friday, and market makers will need to have the shares for them if they don<U+0092>t already. There is a strong possibility of a gamma squeeze Friday with people expecting a repeat of last Friday in a positive feedback loop. 







7 There<U+0092>s also the fact that on Monday, there will likely be less float. This is if we see a repeat of of this week where shares were held up in clearing houses until Tuesday. This would leave us with almost no float on Monday making every move more violent and extreme. It would be easier for Melvin and Co to manipulate the price because of this, but it will be unlikely they have the capital left to do so. If a large short position is closed this could be the most parabolic movement of the whole squeeze. This is the day I<U+0092>m most exited for personally. Regardless of all this there is no telling what will happen the rest of the week. If I could see the future I would be a billionaire.

This is **blasphemy**. On E-Trade right now its literally **impossible** to short the stock (no shares available, check picture). E-Trade is one of the largest trading platforms in the world!

And when you were able to short the stock the borrow rates were **astronomical**.....  not ""average"" as he suggests.... I have posted proof of that as well (I was short GME for a while. Gay bear I know). He paints a picture as if these huge hedge funds are short GME and willing to wait it out for months for their ""short thesis"" to prove true. **This is false.**

**The scary thing about short positions is when they move against you is the get larger.**  What started out as a $10million dollar bet against Gamestop at $5 share price is now a $100million dollar bet if the stock price hits $50. Also consider that many of these funds were probably doubling down as the stock ran up. See how a position that was maybe 1% of your portfolio can quickly become 20% or **even more**.







What Andrew doesn't want to admit is that some of these big funds are holding **massive** bags. I guarantee you it's getting to the point where the juice is no longer worth the squeeze. Shares are getting called back, margin req's are changing (it happened at E-trade), and firms are paying super high interest rates just to hold their position that's getting larger and larger. Not to mention this is  happening in the middle of a crazy bull run. Do fund managers really want to continue holding this position when so much other stuff is hitting all time highs? I could throw a dart at a board full of SPACs and MEME stocks and be up 100% in 6 months, 







Basically what fund managers are beginning to be say to themselves is something along the lines of ""**the markets can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent.""**  Frankly the original ""short thesis"" doesn't even matter anymore for these companies like Melvin. What matters is the stock is up nearly 1000% in the last 6 months and their short position has become so large that it's a massive liability. They aren't stupid. They understand a gamma squeeze could send this thing to  $1,000 and their fund could legitimately blow up. 







What I'm saying is that investors are applying so much pressure that they're going to break. The  thesis of the company changed when Ryan Cohen came on board. That's when you saw institutional **smart/big**  money get on the long side (notice how it was one day after the announcement, analysts had to pitch it to the fund managers first). The companies who are short desperately want to get out of their positions but they don't want to cover at this price. They desperately want the stock to fall to $20 so they can exit their positions without a MTD portfolio loss of double digits. Remember that the people making these decisions got there because they were almost always **correct**. These guys bagholding are feeling the pressure. One bad trade can unravel everything you've worked for on Wall Street.







**What This Means**:  Buy as many shares as you can and **hold** no matter what. **As long as we don't sell we will avoid a massive sell-off**. Let the scalpers get their trades in don't panic. There aren't enough shares available to short for them to drive down the price artificially. Once they start covering and the algos join in we are going to moon again.

Here<U+0092>s why I think so.







Clovis Oncology Inc is currently one of the most shorted stock currently on the Daq at the moment.







1. It currently has a days to cover of ~6.77 which  for those of you who don<U+0092>t know, means if they were to rebuy their positions, it would take 7 days of average trading volume. I<U+0092>m fairly sure $GME is between 3-4 so covering this short position could prove to be difficult for shorters.







2. It has a percentage of float shorted at 42%, this is far lower then $GME<U+0092>s of ~110%-130% not too sure of current figures but still a massive opportunity. In comparison, $BB has a meagre 7.15% of float shorted, and $NOK has 0.9%. The potential for a large short squeeze for $CLVS absolutely shits on them in my opinion.







3. It<U+0092>s Moving averages are all around 6-7 which indicates a strong buy. The moving average crossover happened for all moving averages on the 11th of January and has the graph had risen considerably since. This indicates a strong change in trend and looks like a snowball effect forming with new demand and a short squeeze potential.











4. It opened at $6.80 yesterday and closed at $7.90, a 16% increase. Premarket, it<U+0092>s at $8.12 as of writing.







5. This stock looks locked and loaded to rally HARD. Any spike in demand will enact call options on shorts and cause a nice short squeeze.







6. Lastly, if this gains ANY traction WHATSOEVER on WSB, I definitely see this turning into the next $GME, except this time the train hasn<U+0092>t even left the station yet IMO.







P.S. I hadn<U+0092>t had a lot of knowledge until I spent a while research indicators of short squeezes the last few days (a lot of research), and this is in my opinion the best short squeeze option currently on the market. Please correct me if you think I have said something untrue. 







I cannot claim this solely as my own tip, I had this company as a potential option to go long but credit goes to Norok on trading view, he spotted this potential far before anyone else I have seen: here is the link to his really informative YouTube video:

371,l2vrdf,GME,"Hold 100% of your GME NOW for a dozen of reasons: I'm gonna try to make this quick, TL;DR: it's absolutely crucial you hold ALL your shares now and into the weekend.







- If you believe in astrology aka patterns, [THIS](https://imgur.com/a/sNUBmp0) was GMEs pattern on the 13th of january. You know how it went from there. So absolutely hold everything into the weekend, even if it dips EOD. Mondays are usually greener for GME than other days anyways, with shorties getting to think long and hard over the weekend probably even more so. GME tended to repeat patterns a lot over the last few months, with just the percentage moves getting more extreme each time.







- Don't get cute with trying to exit and reenter on spikes. I admit to doing so and even sometimes daytrading GME the last few weeks to months. This worked well for a certain time where it consistently spiked in the AM and sold off (or got shorted) through the day. Now is not the time to do that anymore, for two reasons:    



1. you will burn yourself, if you just look at yesterdays graph, the shenanigans are going off so hard, it's basically impossible to time or predict anything. You're just risking on losing potential gains.    



2. You hurt the short squeeze by giving shorties potential to sell out of their positions slowly, even it's just small amounts. The harder you hold, the stronger the upwards pressure gets.







- For the especially endangered retards out there:    



No, the squeeze has not yet squoze, this is merely the beginning    



Look at the [DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l2iczw/gme_dd_float_breakdown_moass_speculations/) u/XSh4d0W provided, calculating potential squeeze numbers. Probably one of my favorite pieces of DD from the last few days

372,s3735s,GME,"5.5 Billion Dollars Worth of Calls Lined Up for $GME Next Week: Next week is either going to be a wild week for $GME or a bad time for degenerates. People have bet over half of $GME market cap into calls that expire next week and I think its the reason we are seeing such low prices right now for $GME. In order to prevent the same thing that happened with $GME last year around the first great spike. When market makers and the DTC came before congress they all said the spike happened because of a gamma squeeze. And next week is looking like perfect set-up for another one. If you want to profit of this possibility. I'd recommend buying itm calls and near the money otm calls but its your money so do what you want.







What are your guys thoughts on $GME running again like on the anniversary of its first spike.

Just in case I'm right and this post ends up on TV.","5.5 Billion Dollars Worth of Calls Lined Up for $GME Next Week: Next week is either going to be a wild week for $GME or a bad time for degenerates. People have bet over half of $GME market cap into calls that expire next week and I think its the reason we are seeing such low prices right now for $GME. In order to prevent the same thing that happened with $GME last year around the first great spike. When market makers and the DTC came before congress they all said the spike happened because of a gamma squeeze. And next week is looking like perfect set-up for another one. If you want to profit of this possibility. I'd recommend buying itm calls and near the money otm calls but its your money so do what you want.







What are your guys thoughts on $GME running again like on the anniversary of its first spike.

Posted by u/dwarfboy1717 [1 day ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l5ws97/friday_12921_gme_expiry_date_means_nothing_dont/) **Friday 1/29/21 GME Expiry Date Means Nothing. Don't buy into the hype - shorts aren't just afraid of this Friday. Come down the rabbit hole with me.Discussion**<U+0001F4F7>







*Note: I am mostly summarizing the aggregate of explanations currently floating around about the 1/29/21 option expiry date. I don't claim any knowledge. This is not investment advice. Do your own research, don't invest what you can't afford to lose, and if something feels wrong it probably is.*







**TL;DR: This isn't about options (yet), it's about shares, and Institutional Investors are playing a dangerous game by convincing us (some of y'all have bought in without realizing it) that a magical short squeeze has some 3-day time limit, that Friday is somehow the end game, and are hoping that when investors don't see a $5,000 short squeeze by next week they will fold and take their gains at a ""reasonable"" double-digit stock price. Don't believe them. They can survive through mid-late February before the true short squeeze smashes upward. And I'll be ready. I like this stock and believe in it's long term potential, and I think it's undervalued.**







**THESIS:** If institutional investors can (1) convince retail investors to sell stock at low prices and (2) convince their lenders to wait, then the 0.01% get richer.







**JUSTIFICATION:** There is so much public sentiment (passion, enthusiasm, excitement, anger, whatever) surrounding short (\~1 day) price movements\*, and Friday's expiring options (these are also end of month contracts), that it seems like big clever money may be trying to artificially create a sort of bear trap for shareholders.







Whatever happens in the next week or so (crest to $700? crash to $60?) almost means nothing in the long term, but could fool investors into giving these guys CHEAP ways out of their 140% float short interest positions. Remember, these are people who have been dumping tons of money for a long time, shorting the stock when it was *in the single digits*. They've been hoping for a GameStop bankruptcy, and manufacturing one as best they can.







**IT'S DIFFERENT THIS TIME:** Remember the VW infinite squeeze, where we saw **weeks** of crazy price movement before the actual peak. And that is a mild case, as most of the shares were held by an entity with legal, competitive, and strategic reasons and obligations forcing them to hold shares and **artificially reducing the float, or available shares for trading**. This reduced supply caused the short squeeze.







However, this time around we've got a huge short interest, much much larger by comparison than that from VW's 2008 peak, to the tune of **140% of shares available for trading (float)**. They've massively overreached, and are going to pay the price for that. **But they haven't yet.**







**SO YOU'RE SAYING THERE'S A CHANCE:** This time, however, if the big dogs can shake shareholders hard enough, weak links break and paper hands fold and a fantastic long term play starts to seem out of reach. The market manipulation wins.







**DARE TO BELIEVE:** Unfortunately for the shorts, GME has [real long term prospects](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l2zk5e/a_hedge_fund_managers_perspective_on_gme/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) to revolutionize the gaming industry for consumers, and now has the attention and potential equity momentum (if they play it smart, which I think the new leadership will) to make this a reality.







From that link above:







&gt;In GME's case the rise in the stock price itself will likely result in fundamental improvements to the underlying economic metrics of the company.







I believe.







However, if the shorts can fight, sneak, manipulate, and otherwise adjust the share price down this week then they start to see light at the end of the tunnel. They make 2-3 week plans for doing the same thing. For them, prices don't have to bottom back out, they just have to convince enough people to sell that they buy thrmselves a few weeks before a short squeeze really takes them all under.







\*Some of this price movement is shorts covering, but much is actual legitimate investment between retail investors and other institutional investors who have seen the light. Remember, TSLA didn't get to where it is because one company made some bad short positions. But if GME shorts can convince everyone that a 3-day squeeze is all they get until GME crashes to some ""normal"" level, then they win.







Everyone getting hyped about Friday is playing into their hands. Yeah maybe some will need to take gains after a Friday pop, but a smart long-term hold position on GME is what they're really afraid of. And I want to be a shareholder in GME's future, as many wanted to be with TSLA. And sure, maybe if everyone else thinks that way too, there may be an incidental short squeeze that wrecks the uber wealthy in mid-late February along the way.







**Again, I am not claiming to be knowledgeable or insightful, just commenting my best guesses. Nobody knows the future. This is not investing advice.**

1.) Remove your fucking stop losses how the fuck does this need to be said. Why are you letting a robot <U+0001F4C4> <U+0001F64C><U+0001F3FB> for you?







2.) Half of y<U+0092>all are fucking gods who bought the dip, and got a damn STEAL on some guaranteed lottery tickets 







3.) The other half of y<U+0092>all weren<U+0092>t actually waiting on a dip (even though you guys spam it for upvotes like fucking degenerate gremlins) and pussied out when it was time to display our nuts out for the hedgies to assert our dominance.







The actual important shit:







1.) They are running out of ammo, those drop had fuck all volume behind them. That short attack topped any of the previous attacks, even going back to January. They<U+0092>re running out of short volume and they know it. We are (for real this time) in the endgame 







2.) CNBC and other shill outlets are tightly gagged, we are seeing tangibly less coverage across the board than at this point of the stock price a month ago. Only rarely to be released to revel in any tiny downtick of the share price. This is for a reason. Last time everybody was shitting themselves over GME, it was everywhere. And because of this, MANY retail investors hopped on the train and sucked up a lot of volume in a short period, hence the silence now.

3.) The other half of y'all weren't actually waiting on a dip (even though you guys spam it for upvotes like fucking degenerate gremlins) and pussied out when it was time to display our nuts out for the hedgies to assert our dominance.

1.) They are running out of ammo, those drop had fuck all volume behind them. That short attack topped any of the previous attacks, even going back to January. They're running out of short volume and they know it. We are (for real this time) in the endgame 







2.) CNBC and other shill outlets are tightly gagged, we are seeing tangibly less coverage across the board than at this point of the stock price a month ago. Only rarely to be released to revel in any tiny downtick of the share price. This is for a reason. Last time everybody was shitting themselves over GME, it was everywhere. And because of this, MANY retail investors hopped on the train and sucked up a lot of volume in a short period, hence the silence now.

Simplex Trading LLC is the last remaining financial entity listed in the Bloomberg Terminal<U+0092>s list of PUTs for GME maintaining a file date for their positions of **3/31/2021**.  They also hold the largest number of PUTs (80,702 contracts), twice as many as second in line Susquehanna, and are the highest percentage out (10.550%) among those listed.  All other PUTs have since been re-filed on **6/30/2021**.







I believe these dates indicate historical Collateralized Loan Obligation (CLO) activity associated with GameStop and provide an indication of what to expect as we move towards **9/30/2021** and onward.







### Background







In January, February 2021 $126.6 billion of loans were said to have been repriced ([S&amp;P Global - March 12th, 2021](https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/quick-take-us-clo-refinancing-and-reset-activity-surges-63108875)).







Archegos was liquidated between March 12th and March 26th, 2021 ([Credit Suisse - July 29th, 2021](https://www.credit-suisse.com/media/assets/corporate/docs/about-us/investor-relations/financial-disclosures/results/csg-special-committee-bod-report-archegos.pdf)).  It<U+0092>s been said that the firm turned **$10 billion into an estimated $100 billion** worth of assets ([Bloomberg - April 3rd, 2021](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-04-03/the-number-of-the-week-is-100-billion)). 







&amp;amp;amp;gt; <U+0093>Typically, for new-issue transactions, the CLO debt tranches are collectively 10 times the size of the notional amount of the equity interest.<U+0094> - https://www.stout.com/en/insights/article/primer-valuation-clo-equity-financial-reporting







On March 26th, 2021 the Fed reported a daily Reverse Repurchase amount of $11.4 billion.  By March 31st, the daily Reverse Repurchase amount skyrocketed up to $134 billion.  An increase of $124.297 billion. ([St. Louis Federal Reserve - RRP Chart](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/)).  This was notable because the Fed<U+0092>s RRP activity had been effectively dormant until this uptick.







### Hypothesis







As evidenced by the volume of CLO repricing in Jan/Feb, the end date of the Archegos liquidation, proportion of equity compared to total Archegos assets and uptick in RRPs on March 31st, 2021 my reading leads me to believe that Archegos was more of a CLO Manager than Family Office and that some of their positions (illiquid investments in junk-grade CLOs) were auctioned off and then repriced to SOFR at the end of March 2021.







Historically CLOs were priced off 3-month LIBOR but, out of concern the benchmark was being manipulated by financial institutions, the Federal Reserve is in the process of transitioning CLOs to their own rate called SOFR that is based on the daily RRP amounts ([Bloomberg - July 8th, 2021](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-08/growing-clo-market-has-a-libor-transition-problem-on-horizon)).







9/30/2021 is 3 days away and represents the 2nd-ever quarterly refinancing of CLOs after the formal recommendation of SOFR was made by the Alternative Reference Rates Committee ([AARC](https://www.newyorkfed.org/arrc)) on July 29th, 2021.







There is a process called <U+0093>Warehousing<U+0094> in the CLO world where <U+0093>CLO Managers purchase initial collateral before the closing date<U+0094> which typically lasts 3-6 months ([Pinebridge - September 19th, 2019](https://www.pinebridge.com/en/insights/clo-beyond-the-complexity)).







**9/30/2021 represents the 6-month mark since Simplex filed their 80,702 PUT contracts**.







GME close on 3/31/2021: $189.82







GME close on 6/30/2021: $214.14







GME close on 9/30/2021: ???







### Conclusion







While many of my posts have historically shied away from dates I believe the evidence here is too clear and strong to avoid mention.  Worth noting 9/30/2021 is just *a* date and, given the fact the average tenor of Archegos<U+0092> contracts was 24 months, there could be many other interesting ones as well.

But this post, it still isn<U+0092>t useless now. Have a read you all.







Seeing that a significant interest has developed around the fabled GME short squeeze, I have written this post and I hope this writing provides an overview of the situation.







# The case for a squeeze:







The entire argument for a short squeeze hinges on the possibility that either the management agrees with Ryan Cohen's [plan](https://archive.is/qUm5s) and addresses it or he decides to pursue a hostile takeover.







**In this spirit, we urge you to quickly provide stockholders with a credible and publicly-available roadmap for cost containment, prioritizing profitable retail locations and geographic markets, and building the e-commerce ecosystem gamers deserve.** (from the letter)







This is Ryan Cohen's plan in its most raw form. Or to put it more simply, he wants GameStop to become the ultimate destination for gamers by leveraging its 55 million PowerUp members, its brand power; reducing lossmaking operations in Europe and Australia and to make investments in a Chewy like website for gaming.







Has management been doing anything? Yes. A lot.







[It's hiring talents for building a successful online gaming store.](https://careers.gamestop.com/en-US/search?keywords=&amp;location=Grapevine,Texas,USA&amp;placeid=ChIJX6Af7HUqTIYRDS8xoHABMCw&amp;facetcitystate=grapevine,tx) [Entered into a multi-year revenue-sharing agreement with Microsoft.](https://news.microsoft.com/2020/10/08/gamestop-announces-multiyear-strategic-partnership-with-microsoft/)







It has also received a saving grace by the newest console cycle in which some people thought(like me) diskless gaming is going to be the leader. But the reality turned out to be [quite the opposite.](https://www.pcmag.com/news/report-only-25-percent-of-ps5-pre-order-stock-is-cheaper-digital-edition)







Add to that, the Nintendo Switch sold like wildfire in the US and is going strong, you have a winning combination for GameStop which would likely result in good quarters for the coming quarters.







Management has also started a rebranding effort with some changes being made to its logo, items that are kept in-store and online etc.







It seems like management is likely to address Cohen's concern and the lifeline it has received or will be receiving from the newest console could be its saving grace. If it can turn around or the management gives guidance that it CAN turn around its business model a short squeeze is imminent.







Why would it be inevitable?







[Notice that short interest is almost 3 times higher than its float and more than outstanding shares,](https://imgur.com/a/O3uggvr)







GME as a company is still relatively undervalued (assuming it doesn't go under). If the shorts realize that this company is not going to 0 as they have probably assumed, they will be forced to cover their shorts.







The above-mentioned condition of short interest would guarantee that they have to cover. Also considering the average daily volume, this squeeze can last much longer(3-4 days may be) than the other historical squeezes like Volkswagen short squeeze [when it became the most valuable company in the world for a short while.](https://archive.is/0sDgO)







But given that the scenario surrounding GME is unprecedented, there is no telling how it could end up other than to say that it will be MASSIVE.







[Some shorts are already under water.](https://imgur.com/a/86cGFUl) Some of them are likely covering as noted by various Redditors and retail investors who are looking at the stock tick by tick. Also considering that short interest rose to a whopping 309.83% and is now down to 297.13% (as of this writing from Morningstar data), it's obvious that some of it were covered.







The recent stock price appreciation could be a result of that plus the expectation of good quarterly earnings report.







**Retail mania:** There is considerable retail interest in this stock. Considering that this stock is being heavily promoted in [r/wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets) and driven by that a lot of people are buying shares. According to a survey conducted there(not that reliable, but a good indicator of interest), that subreddit alone has enough ownership to get a board seat.







Open Interest in call options is also [huge](https://imgur.com/a/UvxIGqt) considering that this is only a $1B market cap company. It's filled to the brim with OTM call options(from December 4 to April and further). And market makers and option sellers would have to hedge to serve this crowd, in turn increasing the stock price.







This, in turn, could create a feedback loop where the shorts have to cover their positions, leading to a further increase in stock price, which would force market makers to purchase more shares which could increase stock price and on and on until it triggers a squeeze of epic proportion.







**Likely improving financial health:** [GME announced voluntary redemption of senior notes.](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/11/10/2124246/0/en/GameStop-Announces-Voluntary-Early-Redemption-of-Senior-Notes.html) Management has decided to redeem $125M of its senior notes. This is signalling that the company has managed to generate enough cash flow to cover its debt early.







It could even help improve its credit rating which would help it attract institutional investors more and other perks that come with improved credit ratings.







[Declining debt](https://imgur.com/a/G518yz8) is necessary as it would ultimately help deleverage the company and put it in a more sustainable footing which is ultimately what is needed for avoiding bankruptcy.







**Technical analysis:** This is not my forte. I have bare-bones knowledge in TA and only use it for entry and exit purposes.







But according to some retail investors in Reddit and tradingview GME has formed [a cup and handle bullish pattern](https://imgur.com/a/gj9pzZS).







**Analyst Upgrades:** Analysts are upgrading GME stock. Well, that's good, I guess.







# The Case For Bankruptcy







The scenario in which a short squeeze doesn't occur is PROBABLY the scenario in which GME ultimately faces bankruptcy.







As the thesis for short squeeze is laid out, the thesis for the short sellers is also crystal clear.







After all, GME is STILL a large brick and mortar store that is trying to sell a product that could be very easily purchased using the power of the internet.







The revenue of GameStop for the past few quarters is in [steep decline.](https://imgur.com/a/mTcwpIe) The company is overly leveraged and has many stores that are loss-making operations.







Its online store has much lower visibility and investment and is lacking in many aspects(in my personal view).







Its credit rating is not that good and Cohen himself somewhat criticised the management for trying to hang on to its old ways of doing things.







Gaming and associated products are bound to [thrive and grow at a CAGR of 9% and had grown even more in the past.](https://www.reportlinker.com/p05903704/Gaming-Industry-Growth-Trends-and-Forecast.html)







Yet GameStop FAILS to capitalize on this trend and is continuously losing market share while destroying its [financials.](https://www.morningstar.com/stocks/xnys/gme/financials) This is a clear sign that something is inherently broken within the company.







While the management does seem to be trying to fix things, it could prove to be too little too late.







To change its fortune it needs to turn around its business models like Best Buy or Walmart. Yet it seems pretty unfeasible judging by its financials.







GameStop had adequate time to change with the times and become an early adopter but its backwards-looking culture and late entry made its journey full of competition.







Short sellers believe that ultimately GameStop wouldn't be able to achieve a business turnaround and gain a critical mass of customers in its online space and management incompetency will ultimately lead to its bankruptcy. Thus its faith would be like the numerous mom and pop shops or the various retail giants that were.







Even if GME share rises due to retail mania and market maker hedging; institutional investor ownership could [decline](https://imgur.com/a/04i3a0g), leaving retail investors as the ultimate bagholders. The shorts may bite their tongue and keep on paying interest as long as they believe no fundamental change in the business is going to happen.







Which means they may not need to cover their position as long as the company becomes bankrupt, thus the fabled short squeeze may never materialize.







After all, most shorts are probably institutional investors like Melvin Capital who can always maintain their margin requirements and like the retail investors they can also figure out what the retail investors are trying to do and thus avoid triggering any short squeeze.







They may think, well, game sales are slowly becoming more and more digital, ultimately, platform holders wouldn<U+0092>t give a shit if GME died and die they will. Because the most lucrative part of GME's business is buying and selling old games. So this will ultimately die.







Plus, game related merchandize and other products(which are very lucrative and a huge market) would still remain under the clout of Amazon, Walmart etc, so GME will not be able to survive through that business model.







# Conclusion







The next two or three quarters are pivotal for GME.







    If



    ""Management decides to address Cohen's concerns and manages to show their roadmap to success and improves its financials within the next two quarters = Short squeeze""



    



    Else If



    ""Cohen declares hostile takeover or something close to that line= Short squeeze""



    



    Else If



    ""Management addresses Cohen but fails to deliver within the next two quarters and has disappointing earnings=Unsure"" #improbable cause next two quarters are expected to be good or at least the guidance which is more important



    



    Else If



    ""Management doesn't fully address Cohen's concern, Cohen also doesn't make any move yet the business improves still= Likely short squeeze""



    



    Else If



    ""Management fails to address Cohen's concern, Cohen disassociates himself, business fundamentals detoriorate= Retail bagholders""



    



    Else



    ""I don't know really, imagine your own scenario, you are not bound to my conclusions. In fact my conclusions could be entirely off the mark. We are trying to predict the future here. Hope you come to your own conclusions. :)

GME as a company is still relatively undervalued (assuming it doesn't go under). If the shorts realize that this company is not going to 0 as they have probably assumed, they will be forced to cover their shorts.







The above-mentioned condition of short interest would guarantee that they have to cover. Also considering the average daily volume, this squeeze can last much longer(3-4 days may be) than the other historical squeezes like Volkswagen short squeeze [when it became the most valuable company in the world for a short while.](https://archive.is/0sDgO)







But given that the scenario surrounding GME is unprecedented, there is no telling how it could end up other than to say that it will be MASSIVE.







[Some shorts are already under water.](https://imgur.com/a/86cGFUl) Some of them are likely covering as noted by various Redditors and retail investors who are looking at the stock tick by tick. Also considering that short interest rose to a whopping 309.83% and is now down to 297.13% (as of this writing from Morningstar data), it's obvious that some of it were covered.







The recent stock price appreciation could be a result of that plus the expectation of good quarterly earnings report.







**Retail mania:** There is considerable retail interest in this stock. Considering that this stock is being heavily promoted in [r/wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets) and driven by that a lot of people are buying shares. According to a survey conducted there(not that reliable, but a good indicator of interest), that subreddit alone has enough ownership to get a board seat.







Open Interest in call options is also [huge](https://imgur.com/a/UvxIGqt) considering that this is only a $1B market cap company. It's filled to the brim with OTM call options(from December 4 to April and further). And market makers and option sellers would have to hedge to serve this crowd, in turn increasing the stock price.







This, in turn, could create a feedback loop where the shorts have to cover their positions, leading to a further increase in stock price, which would force market makers to purchase more shares which could increase stock price and on and on until it triggers a squeeze of epic proportion.







**Likely improving financial health:** [GME announced voluntary redemption of senior notes.](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/11/10/2124246/0/en/GameStop-Announces-Voluntary-Early-Redemption-of-Senior-Notes.html) Management has decided to redeem $125M of its senior notes. This is signalling that the company has managed to generate enough cash flow to cover its debt early.







It could even help improve its credit rating which would help it attract institutional investors more and other perks that come with improved credit ratings.







[Declining debt](https://imgur.com/a/G518yz8) is necessary as it would ultimately help deleverage the company and put it in a more sustainable footing which is ultimately what is needed for avoiding bankruptcy.







**Technical analysis:** This is not my forte. I have bare-bones knowledge in TA and only use it for entry and exit purposes.







But according to some retail investors in Reddit and tradingview GME has formed [a cup and handle bullish pattern](https://imgur.com/a/gj9pzZS).







**Analyst Upgrades:** Analysts are upgrading GME stock. Well, that's good, I guess.







# The Case For Bankruptcy







The scenario in which a short squeeze doesn't occur is PROBABLY the scenario in which GME ultimately faces bankruptcy.







As the thesis for short squeeze is laid out, the thesis for the short sellers is also crystal clear.







After all, GME is STILL a large brick and mortar store that is trying to sell a product that could be very easily purchased using the power of the internet.







The revenue of GameStop for the past few quarters is in [steep decline.](https://imgur.com/a/mTcwpIe) The company is overly leveraged and has many stores that are loss-making operations.







Its online store has much lower visibility and investment and is lacking in many aspects(in my personal view).







Its credit rating is not that good and Cohen himself somewhat criticised the management for trying to hang on to its old ways of doing things.







Gaming and associated products are bound to [thrive and grow at a CAGR of 9% and had grown even more in the past.](https://www.reportlinker.com/p05903704/Gaming-Industry-Growth-Trends-and-Forecast.html)







Yet GameStop FAILS to capitalize on this trend and is continuously losing market share while destroying its [financials.](https://www.morningstar.com/stocks/xnys/gme/financials) This is a clear sign that something is inherently broken within the company.







While the management does seem to be trying to fix things, it could prove to be too little too late.







To change its fortune it needs to turn around its business models like Best Buy or Walmart. Yet it seems pretty unfeasible judging by its financials.







GameStop had adequate time to change with the times and become an early adopter but its backwards-looking culture and late entry made its journey full of competition.







Short sellers believe that ultimately GameStop wouldn't be able to achieve a business turnaround and gain a critical mass of customers in its online space and management incompetency will ultimately lead to its bankruptcy. Thus its faith would be like the numerous mom and pop shops or the various retail giants that were.







Even if GME share rises due to retail mania and market maker hedging; institutional investor ownership could [decline](https://imgur.com/a/04i3a0g), leaving retail investors as the ultimate bagholders. The shorts may bite their tongue and keep on paying interest as long as they believe no fundamental change in the business is going to happen.







Which means they may not need to cover their position as long as the company becomes bankrupt, thus the fabled short squeeze may never materialize.







After all, most shorts are probably institutional investors like Melvin Capital who can always maintain their margin requirements and like the retail investors they can also figure out what the retail investors are trying to do and thus avoid triggering any short squeeze.







They may think, well, game sales are slowly becoming more and more digital, ultimately, platform holders wouldn't give a shit if GME died and die they will. Because the most lucrative part of GME's business is buying and selling old games. So this will ultimately die.







Plus, game related merchandize and other products(which are very lucrative and a huge market) would still remain under the clout of Amazon, Walmart etc, so GME will not be able to survive through that business model.







# Conclusion







The next two or three quarters are pivotal for GME.







    If



    ""Management decides to address Cohen's concerns and manages to show their roadmap to success and improves its financials within the next two quarters = Short squeeze""



    



    Else If



    ""Cohen declares hostile takeover or something close to that line= Short squeeze""



    



    Else If



    ""Management addresses Cohen but fails to deliver within the next two quarters and has disappointing earnings=Unsure"" #improbable cause next two quarters are expected to be good or at least the guidance which is more important



    



    Else If



    ""Management doesn't fully address Cohen's concern, Cohen also doesn't make any move yet the business improves still= Likely short squeeze""



    



    Else If



    ""Management fails to address Cohen's concern, Cohen disassociates himself, business fundamentals detoriorate= Retail bagholders""



    



    Else



    ""I don't know really, imagine your own scenario, you are not bound to my conclusions. In fact my conclusions could be entirely off the mark. We are trying to predict the future here. Hope you come to your own conclusions. :)







# Disclaimer







There are various nuances that I avoided writing(which are probably even more important to write) cause it might have taken too much of my time. Writing this post was a good exercise for me and I decided to ride on the GME train after doing so. Before you decide to do anything, you should do your research. This is not financial advice.

475,m1ukkl,GME,"My humble (and amateur) prediction for GME in coming days or so: As GME continues to rise day after day, we creep closer and closer to the all-time high of $483. Heading into the high 200s, new buyers need to make sure they are willing to lose what they are risking, since approaching the $483 mark means a lot of people will be getting ready to sell their hands which were bought above $300, especially above $400. Basically, a lot of people currently DEEP in the red are going to be keen to just abort mission and recover most/all the money they lost. There's going to be a lot of people who thought they had made the worst trade in their life, and any sort of way out will be snatched up immediately, given the SP; 







1. is high enough to offer a decent enough percentage of their loss returned to them, and







2. appears to hit any sort of peak/resistance once over the $300 mark







I believe the SP will creep towards the $300 and start to encounter a lot of resistance. I see the possibility of a $350 peak, before a very abrupt downfall as people in the red see their chances of escape fading, so they cut their losses. This sudden increase in sellers will make recent buyers (since late Feb surge) sense danger. Anybody who was lucky enough to buy sub 100 through Feb will likely see an end to their run and will bail with generous profits. That also includes anybody who bought over $100 who fear their gains may suddenly turn into losses. 







This will cause the SP to plummet suddenly, before a huge amount of buyers jump in, believing they have now managed to enter in at bargain price. This will cause another spike, and will likely bring a lot of sellers back into the mix who sold out of fear, causing the SP to rise very suddenly once again, before slowing back down heading towards the predicted Judgement Day (March 19th). Who knows what will happen then.







So what should you do? If you are thinking of buying in, be ready for some chaos, and be ready to lose what you are risking (that should always go without saying). If you have bought already, be prepared to hold throughout the initial dip that (I believe) will come soon. Selling during the dip will only add fuel to the fire, and you'll be rewarded if you stay.

1. There is no short squeeze and shares are cheap to borrow!







Really?  Then why is there still negative float?  Why the bombardment of negative media coverage, including your tweet timed just as momentum was trending towards the $50 mark Tuesday? Why the flood of brand new user accounts on financial social media sites relentlessly bashing the stock? And a borrow rate of 30%? Doesn't seem very fucking cheap to me.







2. Numbers don't lie, people lie.







Yes fuck taco, you've lied many times to create a panic scenario in order to make money off of put options...thank you for pointing that out.  I'm sure the SEC will be bending you over eventually this year....AGAIN.







Sales being down for console launch was a result of two primary things: bot purchases sucking inventory availability, and the fact that 75% of the malls across the country were at required limited capacities with less average traffic than 20 fucking years ago due to covid.  Hard to sell things out of a store that can't be open.







3. Valuation matters.  







Yes it does.  All future projected earnings were based off of the EXISTING antiquated business model.  It is fairly clear at this point after Cohen's letter to the board in November that the company will no longer be following this business model AT ALL. While we don't have the particulars of the plan yet, we do know that Cohen, his COO, CFO, CMO built an e-commerce from scratch with a little over 100 million funding and turned it in to a business  that within four years had a 20x revenue multiple and made Jeff fucking Bezos back down from competing aggressively against it.







4. Know who's on the other side of the trade.







Here he implies that all the people buying the stock are dipshits that deliver his fat ass Pizza, while the douchebags running Melvin Capital are the smartest guys around.  What he fails to acknowledge is that individually we might be dumb as rocks, collectively we have unending resources for due diligence, and by now have clearly laid out the underlying true value potential far better then the hedgies who's due diligence has amounted to ""short into oblivion cuz it's Blockbuster 2.0, end of story."" not acknowledging the fact that there's greater odds they've just been complacent thinking that no one would notice they over leveraged themselves on what they just assumed was a sure bet.  He also implies that Ryan Cohen would just take the money and run as if this was a fucking swing trade for him.  It's not only an insult to his intent and vision, but it's an insult to our faith in his character.







5. Your company can become your biggest enemy ie. an offering to raise cash and dilute stock value.







You think we give a fuck if they throw out an at the market shelf offer when this hits $300 after we bankrupt fuckers like you?  The diamond hands in this legion are not going to get salty if they lose a quarter or half of their profits after being up 500%.  It is something that they should actually do...but if they've paid attention at all to what's going on (how could they not?) they know that we're on the precipice of a uncontrollable skyrocket of share price that they can take advantage of.  You think they're going to settle for $40? Think again dipshit.  SIDE NOTE: please don't buy at 300 okay retards?

TL;DR: Slow deaths are so painful to witness.







Looking at what is dominating price movements:

Honestly - nothing, the options themselves are controlling the price. How?







https://preview.redd.it/0pt4jg58ily61.jpg?width=469&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=380f65467ff47d71acfaf48687a0faa2f5fb385f







This is volatility mapped against time. The characteristic 'pattern' of vol decrease is characteristics of what I call 'consumer dead stocks'. CCL performed like this for awhile post-2020 dipsies. Back when time's were simplier and tendies frolicked freely.







Anyways - volatility is decreasing and its the dominant force in the stock's price. What's that mean? Depends on where the options are:







https://preview.redd.it/vm7qid4jily61.jpg?width=1132&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7e71d03985fd2ff0019e89273a4e461c190f3faf







Oh look - the only real position is 200,000 PUTS at 1$. What do these options do when volatility decreases in an environment where volatility is the dominant force? They cause hedge-selling. This is made worse when you look at how the option's deltas are changing with price decreases as well - they are delta hedged also by selling. So on both fronts: decreasing volatility and decreasing price are causing selling. Both of which are occurring. But not in a way that is significant for a downward squeeze - but a slow, menacing squeeze like the time you chaffed your wife's bf.







Is there threat of an upsqueeze? Lol. There are 187,581 calls compared to 905,192 puts. People can't even sell calls it seems - so I would say minimal.







TL;DR the TL;DR : GME is sinking into the abyss being held up only by whoever keeps mouth-to-mouthing it with their wendy's check.","GME DD: Since a few asked.







TL;DR: Slow deaths are so painful to witness.







Looking at what is dominating price movements:

Honestly - nothing, the options themselves are controlling the price. How?

This is volatility mapped against time. The characteristic 'pattern' of vol decrease is characteristics of what I call 'consumer dead stocks'. CCL performed like this for awhile post-2020 dipsies. Back when time's were simplier and tendies frolicked freely.







Anyways - volatility is decreasing and its the dominant force in the stock's price. What's that mean? Depends on where the options are:

Oh look - the only real position is 200,000 PUTS at 1$. What do these options do when volatility decreases in an environment where volatility is the dominant force? They cause hedge-selling. This is made worse when you look at how the option's deltas are changing with price decreases as well - they are delta hedged also by selling. So on both fronts: decreasing volatility and decreasing price are causing selling. Both of which are occurring. But not in a way that is significant for a downward squeeze - but a slow, menacing squeeze like the time you chaffed your wife's bf.

546,oxdg02,GME,"WSB meme stocks have been getting PUNISHED since January when GME short squeeze begin: I can't help but think that these two are related. Institutions lost a ton of money on the short squeeze so now they are punishing WSB collectively by destroying our meme stonks across the board. I am not even talking about just the shitty pump and dump meme stocks. I am also talking about high quality growth stocks like Zillow, AirBNB, SNOW, TDOC, Zoom, NIO...etc. 







It all begin with GME/AMC pump, short squeeze and institutions losing a ton of money and now they are destroying everything in their path. SPY and Nasdaq keeps making new highs every day while our stocks have been dumping day after day, week after week, month after month. I see so many stocks down 60% or more from their January highs and one thing they have in common is that they were all popular here.







If meme stonks are doing this badly while the market is making new highs, imagine how badly they will do once the market starts correcting or turning downwards.","WSB meme stocks have been getting PUNISHED since January when GME short squeeze begin: I can't help but think that these two are related.
