[AAPL TA](http://i.imgur.com/E5r2g.gif)

With or without Steve Jobs, the trajectory Jobs has set is pretty clear. The devices will only get thinner, faster, better screens and battery life.

Naturally the software side will also improve as we see the voice to text come to the iphone (yes, my android has had that function for a while already).

The longer term trend here is still intact, even if the stock had to hit $350 range next month, it is still within the uptrend.

As any FA investor would tell you, it would be impossible for AAPL to keep growing at the current rate, you can not expect the market cap to double as it has been doing. As such, this upward trend will be broken sooner than later IMO. 

At that time we will most likely have another long consolidation phase like I have indicated in the white boxes.

Bottom line, still a great company! Just dont expect to double your money every year like you have been doing in the past few years.

[Reuters](http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/10/18/us-apple-idUSTRE79G2U520111018) - Apple Inc reported a rare miss in quarterly results after sales of its flagship iPhone fell well short of Wall Street expectations, hammering its shares.

Shares of the world's most valuable technology corporation dived more than 5 percent to below $400 after it said it sold 17.07 million iPhones -- well short of the roughly 20 million expected by analysts.

Apple's CFO said iPhone sales came in ahead of internal expectations but were hurt in September by customers waiting for a new version.

The September quarterly report was Apple's first under new Chief Executive Tim Cook, who took over in August after co-founder Steve Jobs resigned. The company lost its leading visionary and co-founder when he died October 5.

Cook takes over during a critical juncture for the company, which is battling a fast-rising Google Inc in the mobile arena while fending off consumer electronics giants such as Samsung and Amazon.com Inc.

""Expectations for this company were red-hot, that is why we downgraded it,"" said BGC Partners analyst Colin Gillis, who lowered his rating on the shares days before. ""The reality is their business is not an annuity. They have to sell their quarter's worth of revenue every 90 days.""

""They had a big upgrade cycle with the iPhone, the numbers came in weak. They need to set records every time they report to keep up the momentum.""

From what I understand, chasing a stock price (and, therefore, trying to time the market) is the downfall of many an amateur investor. The typical story is:

* A stock, like Apple, enters a huge breakout.
* As the stock climbs higher and faster, individual investors wait on the sidelines for a pullback.
* When the pullback fails to materialize, and the stock climbs even higher, those investors make an emotional play and give into buying the stock, expecting the upward trajectory to continue ad nauseam.
* As the breakout hits its top, institutional investors take their profits, pulling the rug out from underneath the small time investors.

109,109,AAPL,sdbqk,max_p0wer,9,1,"First, let us assume that most Apple products will follow a (more or less) predictable sales pattern, excluding iPad and iPhone for the time being.  Most of these sales are seasonal (Mac, iPod, peripheral sales spike in the holiday season).  So let's take March 2011 quarterly revenue for everything except iPhone and iPad, and we get 9.5B.  December 2012 saw a YoY sales increase of 16% for those products, so lets assume that stays the same and we get 11.1 B for revenue, minus iPhone and iPad.  This is surprisingly accurate.

Now for the elephants in the room.  iPhone was more than half of the quarterly revenue last quarter.  Last quarter was also the first quarter with iPhone 4S, the first quarter on Sprint, and the first quarter with a new iPhone on Verizon.  I expect iPhone sales are still strong, but less so, so I would expect lower sales than the 24.4B last quarter.  And finally iPad.  While iPad 3 sales have been... stunning... that only accounts for a small fraction of the overall quarter.  iPad 2 sales were banned in China.  I also expect iPad sales to be highly seasonal with a huge spike around the holidays.  So, I doubt it will be as high as the 9.1B in sales from December.  Unfortunately, I don't feel too confident assigning a number to either of those, I simply expect them to be significantly lower than the 33.5B that they sold in December.

Analysts are expecting 36.3B, which means iPhone + iPad sales need to exceed 25.2B, a 25% reduction in sales for those two items.  

So, can they beat 75% of their December sales for these two items?  I'm not 100% sure either way.  I think I'll give a bit of an edge to beating earnings with those numbers though.

- Apple paid the $20 Million to license the liquid metal technology to LQMT in 2010, in terms which are not completely disclosed.  It is unlikely that further royalties would be paid by Apple, but not impossible.  What is most lucrative is that the iPhone would 'kick-start' the technology and it would become an *extremely* hot item for lots of different industries.  
  
- Liquidmetal is (getting away from all the magic internet hype) simply a way to form a metal alloy without allowing the atoms to form lattice-like structures, thereby creating a substance that is **2.5 times stronger than Titanium**, but is more flexible and just as light.  This is not magic, but it is pretty fucking amazing.  
  
- Apple would likely be actually producing any liquid metal tech through a secondary manufacturer like Engel or Materion, especially if used in this generation iPhone.    
  
- Apple has spent billions on non-disclosed costs in the past few quarters relating to creating new manufacturing facilities.  
    
- Upon being contacted by news sources for confirmation of the rumors, Apple declined to comment.  
  
So, I'm not saying that LQMT is invincible, but it damn sure is not the dismal penny stock is was a month ago with no hopes.  
  
And I'm damned sure I didn't let the butt-hurts and the haters here convince me not to put 100% of my capital in it Friday morning/afternoon.

127,127,AAPL,t0vy5,TerranBarron,69,23,"I wanted to start a conversation about AAPL fundamentals. I'd like to avoid as much speculation as possible and focus on the data available. Full disclosure is that I am long on AAPL, but I'm more than open to any debate on the data available on AAPL. 


I'd like to start with 2 observations for r/investing. If people are interested, I can present more in the future. 


First things first, lets take a look at the most basic aspect of a company's finance: revenue and profit
From this first chart, we can see that since 2008 quarterly revenues have grown from $7.5 billion to $46.3 billion.
[Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/nqBLl.png)


This next chart shows that since 2009 (earliest data I could find), quarterly profit has grown from $1.21 billion to $13.06 billion
[Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/iscNM.png)


The most common argument to this data is simply that Apple cannot continue to grow in this manner. While this may or may not be true, I want to point out that there is simply no data supporting this argument. The following charts show that AAPL revenue and profit continue to grow quarterly (Q3 2011/Q32010) at 155% and 200% respectively. Whenever a slowdown occurs, we should see the data in the earnings numbers. Currently I see no such sign of a slowdown. 

[Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/STQQJ.png)   like that typo :P

[Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/lKVOB.png)


For those who are bearish towards AAPL, I'd like to see why? Please present numbers that can be discussed/analyzed. 



My second observation has to do with the iPad. I think this is incredibly important because it is directly tied to the question of where AAPL's future growth may come from. The obvious question is simply: How big is the tablet market? Unfortunately, anyone who says they know the answer to that question is lying. The tablet/iPad market simply did not exist 2 years, and no one knows how big it will get. Those who are bullish will say that tablets will replace all computers, whereas those who are bearish will say that tablets are a fad that will sputter out and die like netbooks. As before, we should look at the data available before making any predictions about the future. 


The following chart summarizes the current iPhone/iPad sales/growth rates.

What you can see is that the iPad looks to be growing at a rate equal to or above the iPhone. Does this mean that the iPad will be bigger than the iPhone in a few years?


Depending on how this goes, I'd like to discuss more complicated questions such as the commoditization of phones/tablets/computers. When will phones saturate in the US? in China? in the world? How about tablets? PE? strategies for investing? etc



All the data/charts are taken from quarterly earnings reports or from asymco.com (the most insightful Apple analysis I have encountered on the web).

Looking into the past: 


On *June 7th, 2010*, Apple announced the iPhone 4. When the announcement was made, (AAPL) was priced at **~$250.94**. After the announcement (AAPL) stocks [declined](http://finance.yahoo.com/echarts?s=AAPL+Interactive#symbol=aapl;range=20100607,20100609;compare=;indicator=bollinger+volume;charttype=area;crosshair=on;ohlcvalues=0;logscale=off;source=undefined;) ~-3.08% with a low of **~$243.20**. This was good for the people who decided to short and the people that wanted a cheaper in to (AAPL). After two days of declining, the next ***eleven*** days (AAPL) steadily began to [rise](http://finance.yahoo.com/echarts?s=AAPL+Interactive#symbol=aapl;range=20100609,20100618;compare=;indicator=bollinger+volume;charttype=area;crosshair=on;ohlcvalues=0;logscale=off;source=undefined;) ~+12.69% ([+9.22% if the stock was purchased on announcement day](http://finance.yahoo.com/echarts?s=AAPL+Interactive#symbol=aapl;range=20100607,20100618;compare=;indicator=bollinger+volume;charttype=area;crosshair=on;ohlcvalues=0;logscale=off;source=undefined;)) with a peak of **~$274.07** before retreating again to a **~$250** near the end of June.


This happened once more with a larger outcome. The announcement for the iPhone 4s was made on *October 4th, 2011*. The stock hit an intraday low of **~$354.24**. In the next *thirteen* days (AAPL) would [peak](http://finance.yahoo.com/echarts?s=AAPL+Interactive#symbol=aapl;range=20111004,20111017;compare=;indicator=bollinger+volume;charttype=area;crosshair=on;ohlcvalues=0;logscale=off;source=undefined;) at **~$422** with ~+12.75% at the end of the day after the slight drop. 

Today (11/11/12), (AAPL) closed at **$660.59**. Looking at the two post-announcement pops, I predict a rise of ~+13% which would come out as somewhere around **~$746.46** as a target withing a time frame between *ten - fifteen days*.

161,161,AAPL,1038ft,[deleted],0,1,"The iPhone 5's recent success was due to two factors, IMO.

First, LTE. I know of many individuals who preordered/looking to upgrade for the better mobile coverage. Now that its here, it's an expectation and not a benefit, in terms of future iPhones.

Second, scheduling. Apple has historically released iPhones in late June/July. The iPhone 4 was released on AT&amp;T on June 24, 2010. BUT, the iPhone 4S was released October 14, 2011, likely due to delays from the Japanese tsunami. The iPhone 5 will be released nearly 3 months after 2 year contracts are due up from the iPhone 4 on AT&amp;T. Verizon iPhone 4's were released Feb of 2011 so they don't count in this equation.

This is all to say that the next iPhone could have poor sales, on paper, unless Apple waits again until October to release (which I would call doubtful), because all of the iPhone 4S users will have to wait until at least October to get an upgrade price ($400 lower, I believe). The bit of saving grace could be Verizon users who have waited from February 2011 until iPhone 6, late summer 2013.

With the iPhone being a massive part of Apple's value, I don't think this bodes well for the stock price.

ALSO, in the computer industry, the hardware and operating system rarely matter any more, as a user can get roughly the same services on either a Windows or Mac machine, including the Windows operating system. The smart phone market, in regards to iOS vs Android, seems to be quickly approaching that. With this latest iPhone 5, Apple has shown that true innovation has been harder to come by, and many of the features are simply catching up to the more often upgraded Android. Apple still holds great competitive advantages in usability, but that hasn't gotten them *all that far* in the computer market, but their business there *is* growing. They may lose some of their more tech savvy iPhone users to Android, as usability [isn't so much a factor to some people](http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/print/9231403/The_iPhone_Apple_was_forced_to_make).

Now, we're talking about the biggest company in the world.

But just looking at a P/E ratio and seeing a nice, low number doesn't say anything on its own. You have to think about the practical reality of these things. It's easy to arbitrarily imagine $700 going to $1000, but a little harder to imagine the worlds largest company become 50% more largest. 


Edit: There are some great comments here about what I have said/PE ratios in general. I agree with most of it - this write-up is narrow at best, I got ahead of myself making assertions. Keep up the conversation, PE ratios are a surprisingly complicated concept it seems. 

10x is not ""the standard,"" notice I said ""if,"" and I do believe that 10x PE is what most companies should have in a more reasonable market, but that may be outdated economics by now. I am sure there are many that would consider 15 to be as good as it reasonably gets.

181,181,AAPL,1248t6,TerranBarron,91,30,"From a financial perspective, I took 3 things away from the earnings announcement. 

1) the iPad is selling slower than they had hoped.
iPads only grew by 26% y/y. This is healthy, but much slower than the iPhone grew. At the equivalent 3rd generation iPhone quarters, iPhone's were still seeing ~100% growth.  

2) iPhone sales are doing ""fine""
Despite fanboys/fandroid arguments about winning the smartphone war, it currently doesn't seem to matter. The market is still big enough that 1st/2nd place still provides plenty of healthy growth. During this transition quarter, the iPhone still saw a healthy 58% growth y/y, which is actually better than the previous transition quarter. 

3) Margins are decreasing. 
Earnings dropped not only because of weak iPad sales, but they also dropped because iPhones are expensive to make. During the earnings call Oppenheimer/Cook implied that margins will continue to drop as all the new products are ramping up, which generally have low profit margins.




In terms of my long term Apple strategy, I look at this way. In my mind, the justification for Apple's stock price growth was due to 2 things

1) Crazy good financials/profits due to the iPhone
This still seems to be true with one caveat. The iPhone SALES continue to grow steadily, and there is currently little evidence showing anything contrary to this. The big question is whether AAPL will find a way to increase their margins again. 


2) The hope that the iPad could truly become ""the future of computing""
This seems to be false. The iPad is major hit, but it's current trajectory doesn't seem like it will be a new computing device that everyone will buy. 

I believe 1) should still support AAPL's share price with it's 14.33 PE. I trust that AAPL will be working hard to increase their margins. This has probably been the thing AAPL has been most reliable about doing.  I will be watching 2) closely in the coming quarter, and if the holiday quarter cannot lift iPad growth y/y to be over 150%, I will have to reduce my position in AAPL.

My primary motivation to be long was two fold: first, up until the last quarters numbers were released, their earnings and revenue and been fairly healthy on year over year number. Looking at the long term horizon, it seemed that much of the sentiment was driven by the increasing competition. The second motivation was that, since the sentiment was becoming so poor after Jobs died, the company looked like an extreme value play.


However, I am beginning to think the story for AAPL may be changing permanently. Looking at the last quarter, revenue fell from 39.2B to 35B Quarter over Quarter, and EPS fell from 9.32 to 8.67.


Not to say a company with ~200B revenue is a bad company, but is this going to be the reality of quarterly revenue for the foreseeable future? I heard &lt;200 a share (on 940M shares) thrown around for the next period, or 188B revenue.


What concerns me is not the cash, nor the debt, nor even the profit record; the company is profitable. What does concern me is the rapid disintegration of the amount of profit, which is making this company from a value perspective almost impossible to analyze.


Are we looking at a short term dip in the larger story, or is this the beginning of AAPL being a shell of its former self, never posting more than 10 billion dollar quarterly profits again?


I'm looking this from the fundamental business health standpoint, not talking about how much you like their iPhone or hate their maps or look forward to their TV or any of that seculative nonsense.

UPDATE 1-Wi-LAN sues RIM for Bluetooth patent infringement
 (Adds details, background)  
    Dec 11 (Reuters) - Patent licensing company Wi-LAN Inc 
&lt;WIN.TO&gt; said on Tuesday it has filed a lawsuit against 
BlackBerry maker Research In Motion Ltd &lt;RIM.TO&gt; &lt;RIMM.O&gt; for 
infringing on a patent that relates to Bluetooth technology.   
    The company said it filed in the U.S. District Court for the 
Southern District of Florida against the BlackBerry maker. 
    Wi-LAN, which has licensed its intellectual property to more 
than 255 companies worldwide, alleged that RIM infringed its 
U.S. Patent No. 6,260,168 related to Bluetooth technologies.   
    Wi-LAN has launched a string of patent lawsuits, including 
one last week against Apple Inc &lt;AAPL.O&gt;, HTC Corp &lt;2498.TW&gt; and 
Sierra Wireless Inc's &lt;SW.TO&gt; U.S. unit over LTE mobile 
technology.  
    In its filing, Wi-LAN alleges that RIM's PlayBook tablet and 
a wide range of its smartphones, including the Bold, Torch, 
Pearl and Storm utilize technology that infringes on its patent.   
    A spokeswoman for RIM was not immediately able to comment.   
    Wi-LAN is seeking an unspecified amount in damages and 
preliminary and permanent injunctions to block RIM from 
infringing its patent.

I have been holding/rebuying AAPL for the past 3 years now as I just feel like they are such a solid/resilient company with great numbers.  I know the 'street' is always iffy on AAPL, as they focus heavily on iPhone sales above everything else.

I have a significant portion of my non-retirement portfolio invested in AAPL (~40% / 100 shares) and I am just wondering how many others are heavily bullish on this company as I am considering buying more since the drop to 500 but I am just not sure if I am nuts or if others find significant value in AAPL even though it has not been as steady as other tech stocks as of late.",Thoughts on AAPL?,,,,2022-01-31 11:10:03,investing,2014-02-03,2014-02-03,15.851138123766006,16.01261121489874,15.746749063139903,15.817076683044434

265,265,AAPL,1xizec,moumouren,17,0,"I have a theory about why AAPL is hoarding cash. I've been following this company intently for the last 5 years and have studied its product range and rationale very intently going back all the way to its Mac days, and am beginning to see (or imagine, whichever you like) a pattern emerge. Now this is more MBA than finance, but I think the numbers on the balance sheet speak for themselves and need no repetition. What's interesting is where AAPL will go from here and how they will overcome this plateau they seem to find themselves in with a maturing iPhone. 

We know that Tim Cook and Jonny Ive have worked with Steve Job as his best friends for over two decades, and it is inevitable that a little of his vision has rubbed off of him onto them. As far as my experience as a broad tech industry follower with Apple is concerned, the company hasn't really changed much philosophically (in its strategic vision and mission). Tim Cook still ends his speeches with, ""we're not here to make money, we're here to make great products"". In other words, the spirit of Steve Jobs is still very much alive in the company.

Now let me be so daring as to put forward a theory. I think AAPL is hoarding cash because its preparing to enter a new segment.  Something massive and revolutionary, in a big way, catching us by surprise again like the iPhone did. Its clear to even the retailests of shareholders that the iPhone product line is maturing and growth is going to slow. They've got a massive pile of cash sitting in different countries doing nothing for a few years, ready to deploy in a flash. Acquisitions and R&amp;D have been ramping up by a factor of 2x for each succeeding year, and yet we haven't seen anything revolutionary from their current products. Everything on the table just seems... stale. The iPhone 5 was the boringests of the new gen smartphones in the last refresh. Mirrors the 3 year hibernation between the iMac and iPod/iTunes, and then between the iPod and iPhone/iPad. And you know what? Try and imagine AAPL coming out with something that will completely redefine itself and wow the masses again. Think about how its image went from being a computer company to a music company, and then from that to a phone company. A large majority of you are probably already thinking about the same product line.

Apple's earnings call is at 5pm EST today and should provide some very interesting information into their forecasts for next quarter, as well as how the products are performing in their newer international markets. 

I'm expecting to hear a very high number of phones sold, simply because they have been heavily discounted at many retailers (Walmart), and have also been picked up in quite a few new stores (Costco) and international markets. I also am expecting a continuation of last quarters high margins.. probably around 39%. iPads I think will be flat, I don't think there has been any catalyst to boost sales there. The only way it may increase is due to last quarter starting with the supply chain filled, whereas this quarter that shouldn't be the case. I think the Mac line will be slightly up this quarter based on some lowered pricing.

I think most price action will occur based on next quarters guidance though, there is so much at play. From the WSJ article about 80 million phones being ordered, that's nearly a 40% boost YOY. I also think they will be able to sell the 5.5"" phone for a $100 premium ($299) which will boost their ASP significantly. I'm confident the new iCloud monthly service is going to increase revenues as well. Seems like an obvious way to make an extra $50/year from a ton of their customers. I think next quarters (and the whole year ahead) mac sales will grow substantially. I personally will probably be buying a new MBP for continuity and I think this will be the best feature to encourage mac sales in the past decade. I don't have much speculation on how the iPad lineup will perform in the next quarter though.

Additionally, the next quarters guidance should hopefully give some hints as to what they're planning with new products. This could be very interesting and I can't wait to hear what they have to say.

What are your thoughts on today's earnings call and where do your opinions differ from mine?

315,315,AAPL,2fjgzo,JimFlim,63,131,"I'm intrigued by the new opportunities that are expected in the next generation of Apple products and services. I think Apple is in the position to truly capitalize on their ecosystem and open a significant number of revenue streams. I'm going to detail them one by one, feel free to poke any holes that you may find.

iPhones: From the rumors in the NYT, Apple has ordered up to 40% more phones over last years holiday quarter (1). This would be in the realm of 70-80 million phones. For the previous q1, we were looking at 56% of their (2) $57B in revenues was from the iPhone, ~$32B. Adding 40% to that figure would give you ~$45B. There is a mixture of phones contributing to this though, and the older model phones will *probably* not see the 40% gain. For this analysis, we're going to say that is a negligible portion of the phones/revenues though. 

The kicker for this calculation though, is that there is a rumored higher end iPhone that will be available. The 5.5"" has been rumored to cost an additional $100 and possibly come with a bigger battery, higher resolution screen, and better camera. In my eyes, there are plenty of people willing to give Apple more money, and moving upmarket seems like a fantastic idea. My best estimate is this could be purchased by 20% of buyers, increasing the average selling price a further $20, from $636 (q1 14) to $656 (~3% increase). This leads to a projected revenue for iPhones of $46.5B.

iPads: I think the holiday season is where the iPad shines, they make great gifts and they're probably too expensive to be an impulse purchase the rest of the year. However, the replacement cycle isn't that quick and there doesn't seem to be any killer features on the horizon. My best guess at this market would be flat y/y at 26 million units, or approximately $12B.

Mac: I think the Mac line is poised for growth. They have been aggressively lowering their prices along which will make them much more appealing to people looking to get deeper into the Apple ecosystem. The continuity features look stunning to me and I think it will be one of the first catalysts in a long time to get people to upgrade their computer. Their Mac sales have been on an uptrend and I think the lower prices will help nudge consumers toward Apple's offerings. I think we'll see over 5.5 million Macs sold vs 4.8 in q1 14. However, with a lower selling price, the total revenue may only increase slightly. This would put us in the realm of $7B.

iCloud Services: One of the things I'm most excited about in the new generation of Apple products is the new and improved iCloud. It seems like it will finally be the service people need, fully integrated into Apple's products, and all at a competitive price. With pricing tiers ranging from $1 to $4 per month and above, this could become another great stream of revenue for Apple. Without any historic data it's quite difficult to gauge what percentage of users would begin this subscription, however I think Apple's freemium model for this service (first 5gb is free) will entice many customers to embrace it. My estimate would be 20% of active iPhones will pay for this service ($1+), and 30% of that group will pay for the higher tier ($4). If anyone has any data or speculation to adjust those numbers, I'd be happy to hear. That would mean (350 million active iPhones * .2) 70 million using the service with 21 million of those on the higher tier. We'll ignore the tiers above that as they probably won't be a significant number. That would be an additional $133 million a month, or $400M a quarter.


HomeKit: This looks like it will be a great licensing play for Apple. The prices of many of these products still needs to come down for mass adoption, but Apple is laying the groundwork to control your home and get their cut of the profits. I think it is too early to have any idea what kind of revenues Apple can expect to see from HomeKit, but it has the potential to significantly strengthen the Apple ecosystem and provide Apple with another stream of revenue.

HealthKit: See Above. 

iWallet (unnamed?): From the seemingly confirmed reports, Apple has managed to negotiate rates that are 15 to 25 (.15 to .25%) basis points below current transaction fees. I would assume that will be the cut Apple is going to take on all transactions processed through their new payment system. It looks like this payment system has the potential to work worldwide and hopefully won't be restricted to just a few countries. The best numbers I can find say that Visa processes over $3T a year, MasterCard does $2T, and AMEX does just shy of $1T (3). It's difficult to gauge how many of these credit card holders have iPhones, and then from there how many would embrace Apple's new service. It appears the average person spends $677 a month on each card (4). If Apple were able to get 75% of its users to embrace this on phones sold this year (we'll guess 200M phones sold this year), that would be ((150M*$677)*.0025) an additional $250M per month or $750M per quarter. This is also skewed by the fact that many people have multiple cards, and Apple customers would generally spend more than the average credit card holder. You could probably safely estimate an extra $1B+ per quarter, and more as the install base grows. On an added note, this should be one of the highest margin services Apple has. This will likely take some time to reach it's full potential as it is rumored to only work with the latest devices.

Beats Headphones + Beats Music: Beats apparently did 1.8B in revenues last year. I don't have much insight as to how they will act under Apple so I think saying flat would be a fair assessment. That would add another 450M per quarter, although more heavily weighted toward the holiday quarter.

iWatch/Wearable: I think it's too early to have any real idea what the financial breakdown of this new product will be. The price point is unknown, although rumored to be in the neighborhood of $400. I think something like $300 is more likely but we'll see. We'll come back to this after Tuesday when we hopefully will see what it can do and when it is expected to release.

AppleTV: If Apple ever manages to work out the proper deals, this could be a significant contributor to their bottom line. Until then though, it unfortunately won't be.

iTunes: iTunes has been growing incredibly, and combined with Apple's other services and software has contributed 8% of their bottom line. If it were continue it's growth it should provide about $5B in the next quarter.

Accessories: Accessories should grow in proportion to the iPad/Mac/iPhone growth and continue to contribute 3% to the bottom line. This would give you an additional $2.2B.

So for Q1 2015 (Holiday Quarter), based on the available data, you could be looking at nearly $75B in revenues. This additionally hinges on the iPhone 6 release date, if it were to be released later than Sept 28, it would artificially inflate Q1 2015 at the expense of Q4 2014 with opening week sales. Gross margins would be tough to estimate as even Apple has had trouble estimating them lately, but to be safe I would say something around 38%. This assumes the iWatch won't be released until next year, if they find a way to get it out before the holidays it could increase that amount by a couple billion. This also leaves Apple with some very appealing growth opportunities in services, licensing, and hardware. In a strong bull case, with the iPhone being released Sept 29 and the iWatch being sold before the holidays, and maybe an iPad Pro offering, Q1 '15 could get up to $80B+. 

A full 2015 projection would be approximately Q1 $75B + Q2 $65B + Q3 $53B + Q4 $57B = $250B. I calculated this based on Apple's general revenue pattern over the course of the year, including a bump in Q2 for when I expect the iWatch to be released. With a gross margin of 38% this would be $95B in gross profit, however with a higher priced phone in the mix, higher margin services, and the potential with licensing, I'd bump that up to 39.5%. Leaving you just shy of $99B in gross profit for 2015. After Op Ex and tax you should be left with around ($99B - $26B (Estimate)) = $73B - 26% Effective Tax Rate ... $57B net profit.

Extrapolating from there, that would be a $9.50 EPS. If Apple were to keep its P/E minus cash ($165B) of roughly 12, it would give you a share price of $140.

Much of this analysis is based on the NYT rumor of Apple increasing orders by 40%. If they ultimately don't increase that order or if for some reason they were unable to move all those phones, this would create a vastly different scenario.

This analysis excludes the iPod as I think its future is questionable going forward. 

I've made quite a few leaps of faith in this, and obviously had pretty limited data to work with. If you have any suggestions or improvements, I'm happy to learn.

365,365,AAPL,2rg8jn,[deleted],0,0,"AAPL stock is $106.25 right now. I place a fair market value of $105.58 on AAPL based on their slightly underperforming yield of 5.44%. The floor for them is $96.90, with a ceiling of $116.11. 


Apple's intrinsic value is dimmed substantially by its close current ratio this past quarter (9/2014). Their positive residuals, free cash flow and net income are excellent, however. 


From a technical standpoint, it's the fourth day of big black candles for them. The current candle is resting on the bottom of a Bollinger band. It's hard to tell if the MACD is bottoming out or not. Based on my reading of their weekly candle chart, APPL has just ""corrected down"" to the center these past two weeks. 


AAPL is a puzzle. While it is fairly valued at $105.3, a buyer might be smart to wait for a bounce at $96.90. However, past behavior suggests that APPL might fall only one more candle down tomorrow, turning white in the process. This past year, similar movement has been followed by a strong upside. That pattern is *highly* speculative on my part.


My overall recommendation is ""Hold"" until midday tomorrow. If APPL continues to fall, it could find a new home in the $96-$102 range (bad news if you bought higher). If the candle is lower but white, that seems like a ""buy"" signal.

The casing of the watch is 18k gold, at about 1200/ounce (24k), AAPL is probably going to use about 1-1.5oz of 18k gold on the watch.  The internals of the watch should be the same as the $350 variant (HW and SW are the same).  If it follows AAPL's traditional 40-60% profit margin (iPhone 6 reportedly nearly 70%), that means the $10k watch will cost them about $1500 (if they buy gold at market price).

This means there is potentially $8500 profit in each of the high end watches (not considering some are sold for upto $17k).  Sell 10,000 watches a quarter (which is nothing considering China and India love gold and have over 2.5billion people), and that's 85 million in profit a quarter and nearly 100 million in revenue.  Sell 100,000 high end watches a year that's $850,000 million in profit and nearly a billion in revenue.  

Why would AAPL ever want to get involved with building a car, if they can sell 1 watch (which is much easier to build, design, etc than a car) and make more profit.

Is it just me, or does this high end watch really drive the price of AAPL higher?  I can see it going to 140-150 by Dec 2015.

But that also means that success in trading on productivity of the company makes it easy to confuse for having a 'real' grasp on the emotions that drive the short term behavior.  This is a mistake.

I was originally given submitter status here for probably the wrong reasons--I had just told most of /r/personalfinance to just index everything, because honestly not many people have the knowledge to do more.  *I* personally don't, and any stock trades I do, I see more as mental exercise/pursuit of my investment hobby, and nothing more.  I think it is fantastic what some of you do here and I read your posts to sharpen my mind and gain insight so that I can become better at my hobby.  But I am probably never going to reach a level where I feel comfortable trading more than 5% of my portfolio actively even if I have the free trades from my brokerage to do that at will.  

And as a result, I am never going to experience the emotional stress I am seeing some of you guys going through when things don't go the way you expected, even when you were right.  Because that's how the market is.  It's not there to make *you* rich or to build up your ego.  The long term index uptrends are there and will continue to be a boon to anyone with a retirement mindset.  That's where I have made nearly all of my money.  I'm a physicist and tend to look at market forces as being not so different from fundamental forces.  The long term growth of productivity and stagnation of worker wages is kind of like the gravitational force.  It's relatively predictable based on clear and quantifiable factors.  It has a clear direction, although that direction is not always up.   Emotions and valuations and technicals and even market fundamentals are nothing more than quantum electrodynamics by comparison--more significant in the NOW, but totally irrelevant when you're actually needing this money in your old age, and ultimately the momentum generated by it largely balances out over time.  And pretty wholly divergent from the ever higher march of productivity.  Predictable to some extent, but there's always going to be uncertainty.  That's just how small-scale effects are.

$58b in revenue 

Increased dividend by 11%, increased total capital returns to $200b 

$194b in cash

61M iPhones, 12.6M iPads, and 4.6M macs sold during the quarter. 
Here is where it gets interesting, research firm IDC estimates that overall computer sales fells 7% this quarter, while apple grew their computer sales by double digits.

Growth in China:
Sales increased in China by 71% year over year
Expected to have 40 stores in china by next year and a 100 by 2020. 
recently paid a real estate developer $2.5b to help them acquire property in china. 

Apple Watch:
apple is doing a delayed product launch to fine tune their baby by constraining the number of watches available. The first new product since 2010 has many excited about the potential the watch could hold.  Tim Cook expects the supply of apple watch to be readily available overseas by late June. Additionally stores like target, Best Buy, and Wal Mart will be receiving Apple Watch outposts on their sales floor this year.

Some fundamentals:
Forward P/E: 13.4 
ROA: 15.22%
ROE: 35.15%

Concerns:
Apple is very reliant on the success of the iPhone.
Apple watch perception and adaptation in society.
Slowing iPad sales in part because of the increased size of iPhone screens cannibalizing iPad sales. Very competitive table market.

*-400 Jun'15 126/127/134/135 Iron Condor @ .43 ($17200 Credit)*

**Entry:** IV low, but has been trending down in AAPL for weeks. Strong Resistance at 133 after latest catalysts (Ichan, JP Morgan iphone Estimate Upgrade, etc.) and strong support at lower 129 that quickly returns to 130. Tons of open interest over the next 2 weeks around the 130/131 strike will likely keep this from going far from these strikes without a catalyst to overcome option volume. WWDC is almost a non-event, maybe slightly bullish, market agrees with me, no tangible IV premium for the event. No other foreseeable catalysts coming up to really move this stock in the next 2 weeks.

**Exit:** Jun-12 or Jun-15 will be my exit. Buy back early to avoid quad-witching craziness. Profit target of 50 - 60% max profit.

The two things that jump out at me are his removal of cash during his valuation (around $25 per share), and mostly basing his valuation on ratio analysis (P/E). I understand that this likely keeps it pretty simple, though not sure removing all cash is prudent.

We've never seen anything like Apple, so using relative comparisons is useless. They're too big to fail, and have too much going on behind the scenes to declare the innovation has died. We simply don't know that. All we have is these earnings reports, where they are making stupid amounts of money. Billions. Cash is still piling up, money is flowing like never before, even when consumer sentiment has leaned negative for, honestly, years now... Have they cracked the laws of large numbers? It's as if the biz ops have reached a threshold that allows for subpar operation, in terms of product output to consumers that'll still rake in unprecedented money. 123 right now might not be a bargain, unless you have tens of thousands to throw at it, or recycle other holdings towards it... but I am just not sure what to think anymore. Eventually there will be a downward spiral, but it's not right now. Right now, we're all wondering when it will bottom out a little bit, and when it will reach an all-time again. Because that's inevitable, almost. As inevitable as it gets on Wall Street for a big firm, IMHO. I SAY.... enough of this few-product BS. Expansion is necessary when you are no longer innovating with your core products. The competition has more than caught up in terms of performance, and whilst nobody offers the completeness of Apple, including aftermarket support, design, prestige, etc., something WILL give.

Based on my model (which I fully admit is not the be-all end-all of insight, and I fully acknowledge my model can 100% be wrong), I'm getting a share price of $107/share (using a 10% discount rate). So to me, feels like AAPL is fairly priced at the moment, though I tend to be very conservative with my future estimates. 

The piece I'm struggling with is how to account for buybacks in the model, so I was curious if anyone has any suggestions for doing so? Should I just lump them in with dividends and assume a future payout ratio combining the two, or does it make sense getting into the nitty gritty of shares outstanding by reformulating the shareholders equity statement (which I've currently done)?

Or at least are there better more reliable options rather than keeping your share in AAPL.  They haven't had the greatest time recently, they're only a little above 10 dollars from where they were 52 weeks ago.  Normally I'd expect higher results from such a big contender.

So, if fear is the only thing driving AAPL down, then the only question becomes how low is AAPL going to go before fear is replaced by greed and the stock becomes bullish again?

The answer is likely somewhere between $90-99. If AAPL hit 90, I would jump at the opportunity (I think many people would). We've hit 98 in pre-market now. It wouldn't be the worst time to pick up some stock at least, or if you have a bit more risk appetite, some October/December calls.

690,690,AAPL,3vt52s,SIThereAndThere,70,8,"One week ago we reported something unpleasant for the world's largest company: China Daily had reported that Apple's key Taiwanese supplier, Pegatron, had halted hiring ""due to poor iPhone sales."" Today, Credit Suisse confirms much of the cautions laid out previously in a note in which it says ""iPhone supply chain orders have weakened recently. In our view, the continued weak supply chain news could weigh on Apple shares for the next few weeks/quarters."" 

As a result of the change in sales expectations, the Swiss bank is lowering its CY16 EPS estimates by 6%, but since it doesn't want to get on Tim Cook's bad side, says that it continues to ""believe that with high retention rates, continued installed base growth, and the optionality of a smaller 4-inch iPhone, Apple remains an Outperform."" 

In other words, the current weakness, previewed here, is ""transitory"", or so CS hopes.

Here are the details from Credit Suisse' note on Supply-chain cuts:






Production cuts. Apple has lowered its component orders by as much as 10% according to our teams in Asia. The cuts seem to be driven by weak demand for the new iPhone 6s, as overall builds are now estimated to be below 80mn units for the December quarter and between 55-60mn units for the March quarter. We lower our CY16 units to 222mn from 242mn to reflect this and assume 235mn for 2017 (6% growth y/y).

 

Downward revisions anticipated, but coming sooner and deeper. The downward revisions came in earlier (November 2015, versus December 2015) and deeper (by 10% versus earlier expectations by 5%) than anticipated. We believe the softer- than-expected demand could be due to (1) currency volatility, (2) the lack of attractive Apps supporting the new force touch function (which has been the key selling point of iPhone 6s), and (3) macro uncertainties.

 

Data points suggest a weaker 1Q16. Current data points suggest the production cuts are mostly in the December quarter. However, as the new smartphones have only been available in the market for one month, we believe 1Q16 cuts could be potentially more significant. As a result, we now expect the component supply chain to see a single-digit YoY decline in 4Q15, and ~20% YoY decline in 1Q16. The aggregate number of iPhone builds is now expected to be in the range of 55mn to 60mn in production in the first quarter of 2016.

 

Pegatron sets solid 4Q guidance. For assemblers, 4Q15 earnings appear solid based on guidance, but 1H16 may be at risk due to iPhone. iPhone component cuts could lead to 1H16 risks for assemblers. Apple may shift to greater 6s orders to Pegatron as Hon Hai is exclusive on the new 4"" model. We expect Pegatron to ship 22/18mn iPhones in 4Q15/1Q16 and 66mn/70mn in CY15/16.

 

Is the supply chain a good read? It is worth remembering that Apple's supply chain is vast with an additional complication with the timing between Apple's sell-in and sell-through numbers. Additionally, what is important to note with these estimates is the strong correlation (R = 0.95) between production builds and reported sales, as shown in Exhibit 2 over time

It's estimated it does ~$6.5b in net revenue (not gross), and I'd wager has **very** high margins (maybe 40% net). But let's be really conservative anyway, and say the net margin is only 20%. We'd still be pulling home $1.3b/year free and clear. 

While a slowdown in growth alarms the WSJ for some reason:

&gt;Though the App Store is growing at an impressive clip, there are signs of slowing growth. The company had said App Store billings grew 50% in 2014, but Apple<U+0092>s figures suggest that sales growth fell to about 40% in 2015.

How many standalone $6b/yr companies have grown at 40% this year? One company you might have heard of called Netflix grew at about half that with *slightly* more in revenue, but with **way** worse margins. Probably around 90% worse in fact.

Apple announced management changes that we believe increase focus on operations management, semiconductor design, and the App Store. We see all of this as positive for the company.

<U+0095><U+F020>**New COO Jeff Williams:** Apple named Jeff Williams as its new COO. Jeff is currently the SVP of Operations, and, according to Apple, he has overseen Apple<U+0092>s entire supply chain, service and support, and the social responsibility initiatives since 2010. Apple said that Jeff played a key role in the company<U+0092>s entry into the mobile phone market with the launch of iPhone, and he continues to supervise development of Apple<U+0092>s irst wearable product, Apple Watch. Note that Tim Cook had never backfilled himself as COO after taking the helm as CEO.


<U+0095><U+F020>**Johny Srouji named to the executive team:** Johny Srouji is SVP, Hardware Technologies and is responsible for leading Apple<U+0092>s silicon efforts. Johny joined Apple in 2008 to lead development of the A4. Apple said that Mr. Sroji built silicon and technology engineers teams at Apple, overseeing custom silicon and hardware technologies including batteries, application processors, storage controllers, sensors silicon, display silicon and other chipsets across Apple<U+0092>s entire product line. We see proprietary semiconductor design as a key element of the company<U+0092>s ability to continue to differentiate its products in the future.


<U+0095><U+F020>**Phil Schiller takes over App Store:** Phil Schiller, SVP of Worldwide marketing, is expanding his role to App Stores across all platforms. Apple said that Phil now leads nearly all developer-related functions at Apple, in addition to his other marketing responsibilities, including Worldwide Product Marketing, international marketing, education and business marketing. The increased App Store focus is clearly needed, in our opinion, with recent criticisms of the Mac App Store in particular being at issue. We also believe the Apple TV App store offers significant potential and deserves additional management attention.


<U+0095><U+F020>**Tor Myhren named new VP of Marketing Communications:** Apple said Tor Myhren will join Apple in CQ1<U+0092>16 as VP of Marketing Communications.

727,727,AAPL,42sb7h,SIThereAndThere,10,4,"**iPhone expectations lower:** We are forecasting ~76m iPhone shipments in FQ1 (to Dec) and ~55m units in FQ2 (to Mar). We believe that general buy-side expectations are in the low 70s for FQ1 and ~50m for FQ2. Based on our model, ~50m iPhones for FQ2 would translate into total revenue of ~$52bn (-10% Y/Y), ~6% below our current estimate of $55.5bn and 6% below Bloomberg consensus of ~$55.7bn.

**China Mobile 4G net adds:** 4G net adds momentum recovered at China Mobile towards the end of FQ1. Net Adds grew 33% Y/Y in December, up from 19% in November but below the 46% Y/Y in October.

**Lower repurchases:** Between Oct 9 and Dec 28, we believe that Apple reduced its net share count by ~31m, implying a net repurchase of ~571k shares/trading day (in ~54 trading days) vs. ~647k shares/workday last year (in ~61 trading days). We are slightly concerned that our total repurchase estimate of ~$7.5bn for FQ1 (+49% Y/Y) may turn out to be optimistic.

**Asia supply chain indications:** Our Asian supply chain analysts believe that build plans for FQ2 have likely stabilized in the 40-45m range now, down from 45-50m in December. If correct we believe this would likely be due to higher inventory levels exiting FQ1. We note that 5 days during the holidays in 2015 fell into FQ2 vs. 4 days in 2014, and 3 days in 2013 <U+0096> thus exacerbating possible demand weakness but potentially then helping units in FQ2.

**Weak Europe/US supply chain results:** Beginning in October with Dialog and continuing right through January with weak reports from Qorvo, Cirrus Logic, Multi-Fineline Electronix and ADI, the supply chain has been almost universally weak leading up to this report.

**ASP risk:** We believe there is some risk to our $680 ASP estimate for the iPhone given continued mix shift toward the lower-priced iPhone 6 away from the 6s. This shift would likely have been exacerbated by macro-driven demand weakness.

**FX headwinds:** FX remains a headwind for FQ1<U+0092>16, in our opinion. According to Apple, unfavorable FX had a negative 8pp impact on Y/Y revenue growth in FQ4<U+0092>15 and ~4pp negative impact in FQ1<U+0092>15.

**FQ1<U+0092>16 estimates/guidance/consensus:** For FQ1<U+0092>16, we are forecasting total revenue of $76.72bn (cons: $76.59bn, guid: $75.5-77.5bn), gross margin of 39.8% (cons: 39.9%, guid: 39.0-40.0%), opex of $6.31bn (cons: $6.42bn, guid: $6.30- 6.40bn), EBIT margin of 31.6% (cons: 31.5%), Non-GAAP EPS of $3.37 and GAAP EPS of $3.25 (cons: $3.23).

728,728,AAPL,42tc23,SIThereAndThere,2,9,"**What's changed**

Apple will report Dec quarter results after the market close on Jan 26. We are forecasting F1Q (Dec) revenues of $76.8bn (+3% yoy, vs. guidance of $75.5-77.5bn), in line with consensus, and EPS of $3.28 vs. consensus at $3.24. For F2Q (Mar), we are modeling revenues and EPS of $57.1bn (-2% yoy) and $2.30 vs. consensus of $56.5bn/$2.26. **We expect guidance for the March quarter to be $53-55bn in revenues,** accounting for Apple<U+0092>s typical conservatism, which we believe is above buyside expectations.

**Implications**
Apple shares are down 12% over the last month, in line with our coverage but worse than the S&amp;P/Nasdaq decline of 8%/10%, as a number of negative supply chain datapoints have pointed to weaker iPhone sales.Indeed, our survey of 1,000 US consumers last week shows that holidaypurchases of the iPhone were below original expectations, while higher prices in key int<U+0092>l markets (to offset their FX depreciation) have dampened demand in certain regions such as Japan. We see the current weakness as a buying opportunity, for several reasons: 

**(1)** we believe the guide-down is already expected/priced in, 

**(2)** Apple is a defensive stock relative to the current market sell-off, 

**(3)** the March quarter represents the trough in yoy revenue growth, which is typically a good time to buy hardware stocks, with easing comps and the next product cycles (iPhone 5e, 7) driving acceleration for the remainder of the year, and

**(4)** we expect the multiple to increasingly reflect the evolution to <U+0093>Apple-as-a-Service<U+0094> (recurring hardware &amp; services as users shift to iPhone installment plans and adopt new products/services in the Apple ecosystem, such as Apple TV, Music, Pay, Watch, etc., making the 500mn iPhone installed base stickier).

**Valuation**
Our 12-month price target of $155 is based on 15X our CY16 EPS of $10.32.

**Key risks**
Product cycle execution, end demand, and a slower pace of innovation

Probability of it going to 55 without a run up is 3%. If you look at each entry as a potential rebound. 

How you should take this trade.

1) determine your max loss for the trade. let's say its $5000. 

2) Split it tiered over the those 5 entries to get an average closer to the median.

250$/97

See original post here :

https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/4glx7v/here_is_where_to_buy_aapl/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=link

When you buy low (on a downturn) the chances of it going straight down almost never happens. The question is, when does it rebound? You can't predict it.

When you buy High and expect higher, the chances of it going straight up also almost never happens. However, after a run, you expect a pull back at some point (people taking profit). 

So which do you think has a higher probability of success, if you're trading the same company? 

Now, this works best when you pick companies that fit the following criteria (fundamentals):

 1) Large, well traded companies. - will have patterns and well defined support/resistance  points. 

 2) Strong brand - likely be part of big player portfolios i.e pensions etc.

 3) healthy balance sheet and earnings i.e its not bleeding cash (be the cause of it losing its value, especially if its already hit a mature state).

 4) embedded into the economy in some way - less likely to go bust.

 5) pays a dividend - reduces your risk.

This works even better when you manage your risk per ticker.
What this means is, you don't throw all your cash in at one shot. You wouldn't go to a casino and throw your gambling money on black or one hand. So why would you do this here?  

How you do this is - enter into a trade incrementally. Why?  

1) you can be wrong in your pick

2) The company can have some black swan event come up

3) The market as a whole can have a black swan event


How do you incrementally enter in?

1) consider your WHOLE portfolio size. If that is 5k,10k, w.e
2) consider the size of the trade. You don't want a trade taking a large portion of your account. 
3) have predetermined price points. I go all the way down to zero, since that's the worst case scenario. 

you can do the same thing with options as well. However, that requires a little more work.

* I have closed my VRX short position at a small loss in order to make this trade.

* I will now try to slowly grind back to money I lost. This means smaller position and risk.

* AAPL will crash massively after its earnings release date on July 26th. It almost always crash anyway and this quarter in particular will be terrible.

* It almost pains me to do that, but it must be done.

* Apple is still a solid company, but short-term, it has many challenges it cannot quickly adapt too.

* Apple is about to have the worst quarter in years. iPhone sales are down. iPad are still going down. 

* The USD is too strong and their hedges rolled off. Also, Apple had a lot of its cash in GBP. They are going to have a terrible earnings release.

* Apple has nothing to bring to the table. The watch is a failure.  iPhone have plateaued. The 7 might restart it but that's several months from now.

* All this to say, this quarter's earnings will be terrible and have not been fully priced in the stock price.

* I have to decided to sell ITM call because a) I will gain money from time decay b) I will gain money from volatility crush c) Apple should crash 4-5% post-earnings, making the calls OOM and thus, I keep the entire premium.

Apple seems like a sure short right now, if only for the post-earnings pullback and weak momemtum. I am going to enter such trades in the future to slowly rebuild my capital.

Earnings are on the 26th, and the stock is near its highest point since its last earnings report, when the stock dropped more than 10% over the course of a few days based on lower than expected EPS, weak guidance, and on being the first time in a long while that AAPL didn't experience a higher growth % compared to the previous quarter.

* AAPL may well beat EPS, but what's important is guidance. AAPL is a growth company, and if it's not able to maintain its exponential growth, and if it doesn't reveal any solid plans to maintain said growth, you can be sure investors are going to flock elsewhere.
* [This fucking interview lol](http://www.cnbc.com/2016/05/02/tim-cook-the-most-important-thing-for-apple-long-term.html)
* Stock is nearing $100, where it has massive resistance. It's not likely to convincingly break this resistance leading up to earnings. Again, what has the company accomplished in the last quarter?
* Last time leading up to earnings, AAPL stock hit a multi-month high, and then started trending steadily downwards. This info, combined with the above, leads me to believe the stock may start trending downwards.
* Get your puts now before pre-earnings premium sends put prices through the roof... if you're confident the stock won't float above $100 leading up to earnings, that is.
* I just can't imagine what good news could come from the earnings report. What revelutionary plan will AAPL present for continuing its growth and expanding its client base?

While the company reported strong sales of the smaller iPhone SE launched in March, overall its current models have failed to meet the booming sales of its first batch of large-screen iPhones, sapped in part by cooling demand in China and U.S. customers holding on to handsets for longer because of changes in carrier contracts.


The results, and Apple<U+0092>s expectations for the current quarter ending September, were better than what Wall Street feared, and the stock rose more than 6% in after-hours trading.<U+00A0>


A bright spot was Apple<U+0092>s revenue for services, including subscriptions to Apple Music, fees from Apple Pay and sales of apps. The company said services revenue rose 19% to $5.98 billion.
While iPad revenue increased 7% because of its pricier iPad Pro, unit sales fell for a 10th-straight quarter, down 9% to 9.95 million.
Sales of Mac computers fell 11%, marking a third-straight quarter of decline.

Shares dropped by 10% in after-hours trading. Investors were forecasting $682 million in sales for the third quarter.


Twitter's user base increased about 1 percent to 313 million average monthly active users in the second quarter from 310 million in the first quarter.


Earlier this year, Twitter laid out a long-term strategy to turn around its business, focusing on five areas: its core service, live-streaming video, the site's ""creators and influencers,"" safety and developers.

second quarter was stronger than Wall Street had expected as the company narrowed the loss of video subscribers and revenue took off.

Comcast lost 4,000 video customers, which was the best second-quarter number in more than a decade, according to the company.

933,933,AAPL,51wwms,PrismSensor,5,0,"These are not my predictions, but my friend's (who is a former stock broker and now investment banker)

1. AAPL's stock price will likely plunge another 10% from now through September 2017. He sees AAPL's stock price being boxed in the $90~$95 support level within 6 months. 
Rationale: Apple's iPhone 7 wont sell well and this is justified by low parts orders by Apple's part suppliers/contractors. 

2. Samsung currently has an edge in hardware innovation over Apple. The public perceives Samsung's products to be more technologically advanced due to its curved OLED technology. 
He thinks that Apple's contract to buy 100 million Samsung OLED displays in 2017~2020 was a good decision for the AAPL stock price. He thinks that this change has the potential to send AAPL stocks soaring to at least $120~$130. 

3. AAPL's stock price from 2017-2018 may or may not look very different from now according to these variables:

a) if Apple releases something revolutionary, such as the highly speculated VR product, then the stock price may become very volatile depending on its success. If public reception is poor, stocks could sink further into the $74~$80 support level last seen in early 2014. 
If public reception is positive, he sees AAPL potentially reaching above and beyond the May 2015 peak of $133. 

b) If Apple does not release a VR product/something revolutionary, the stock price may again be boxed in the $90~$95 support level or sink further into the $74~$80 support level. 


He claims that Apple will likely not release a VR product until at least 2018, especially since VR products are very expensive and the development of content will have a significant lag phase. 

This is just one expert opinion, and a very educated and informed one at that.

981,981,AAPL,59gol7,ILoveSushi1337,11,2,"So I was correct yesterday in predicting a pullback to $115 or lower after Apple announced their earnings. I've been analyzing AAPL stock for months now and this is NOT a stock to buy, in my opinion. 

It is a stock to hold at this stage because of the post-earnings dip and the potential for Apple to surprise us with a much overdue new growth engine product. 

Many investors were buying AAPL stock yesterday before earnings release in anticipation of an earnings surprise and for the stock to go up a healthy 3~5%. Instead, the stock dropped 3% after market hours, which looks like it will be an even bigger 3.5% dip this morning pre-market. 

So will the stock stabilize at $115? My predictions are as follows:

1. AAPL stock will retreat back to the $107~$109 support level and will remain 'trapped' for some time. It could plunge to $90~$100 (moderately likely) if this support level doesn't hold, but resistance will be seen at $107~$109 (likely for now) OR $112~$115 (unlikely unless Apple surprises us in the holiday season.. another unlikely scenario going by market trends and analyst data). 

2. Higher memory prices will also put a dent in Apple's profit for 2017. Memory prices are already at a 2-year high and is forecast to get even worse in 2017. Apple buys majority of its memory modules from Korean companies, Samsung and SK Hynix. Analysts say that the discontinuation of the Galaxy Note 7 also increased mobile memory prices, which is ironic because it actually helps Samsung's profit margins. 

2. It is doubtful that Apple will recover sales in the upcoming holiday season. This will also hold down AAPL stock. 

3. Apple's iPhone sales in the all-important Chinese market was very weak, at -30%. This will only get worse as Chinese customers have become so loyal to their local brands, especially Huawei. 

4. While the Galaxy Note 7 was officially cancelled, Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge sales have skyrocketed ever since. This was unexpected and may help Samsung to regain market share over Apple.

5. Apple is 'trapped' in a limited smartphone industry which is highly saturated. Project Titan was scaled back/cancelled and Apple potentially lost billions of dollars in R&amp;D costs on Project Titan. Unless Apple finds a new growth engine, I think the long-term projection for AAPL stock will be $90~$100 again, as seen in June/July this year.

Things have mostly played out as I predicted (short of Icahn as Treasury secretary, although he was informally offered the position by Trump, AAPL had a total return of ~22% in 2016.) I expect the stock to do well into Q4 earnings and close above $150 by 2018.

I suspect in the first 100 days of Trump's presidency we will get clarity on a capital repatriation tax ""jubilee."" For AAPL there are three countervailing forces as it pertains to Trumpism. 

1. Large offshore asset holdings (large as in astronomically large) that stand to become much more valuable under differential tax treatment and a Trump DOJ allowing more M&amp;A flexibility (potential Time Warner acquisition perhaps held up by anti-trust concerns in an Obama DOJ paradigm or price).

2. Chinese manufacturing of electronics is an affront to Trump (hero of the working class, champion of American national socialism) ideas of ""hire American, build in America.""

3. New tariffs and trade regulations, trade war with Chyna.

[Tim Cook](http://s.newsweek.com/sites/www.newsweek.com/files/styles/embed-lg/public/2016/12/20/donald-trump-apple-tim-cook.jpg) can alleviate #2 very easily by funding a new project to manufacture in the United States (self driving car, free standing home device, next gen iPhone etc.) and have no material impact on AAPL's business or balance sheet; creating 500 jobs and a state-of-the-art mostly autonomous factory for a few billion is a drop in the bucket for AAPL. A small price for political favor with Trump.

Trump will not destroy AAPL with #3 but it is the point of most concern. Likely new trade negotiations will take time (1-2 years) and I doubt Trump will pursue policies of mutually-assured economic destruction. GS rallying 30% post-election with the S&amp;P up 10% suggests the market doesn't think so either.

going on and need explanations on my trades, or what puts and calls are. Thank you.
Three and a half years ago, my favorite uncle died after a short battle with cancer. Up until the moment he
died, none of us even knew he was sick. Uncle Richard was a secretive man who lived a secretive life. He
didn""t like to discuss his personal matters. We saw him once or twice per year, at family gatherings,
where he usually stood alone in a corner, slowly drinking his brandy and seven-up.
I was one of the few people who took the time to go talk to him. Truth be told, I rather enjoyed his
presence. He was a tenacious listener and he had the gift of always making you feel appreciated. After his
wife died in her late 40s, I think he had some kind of breakdown, from which he never recovered. I know
that he truly loved her and the rest of his life was spent living alone in something he sometimes described
to me as an ""unending fog."" Our family invited him because, well, he was part of the family, and also
because he was generous with his bottles of homemade wine, perhaps his only passion in life, or at least
the only one that we knew of.
The day he passed away, I learned he was bequeathing me over 2.5 million dollars.
My uncle had never really had a career or a profession of any kind. He stuck to the usual odd jobs, being a
trucker here, working in security there, even teaching at some point, but he would usually never last long.
When he died, everyone was shocked at the fortune he had managed to amass. But my uncle was an
ascetic and austere man: he lived in the same, tiny house he had built by himself for $10,000 decades ago,
drove a car that was older than me and wore the same clothes quite possibly since his high school times,
year after year. He preferred to repair rather than rebuy and still had that giant, clumsy television from the
80s instead of that shiny new LCD. All in all, it""s crazy to think what an average man, living an average
life, can accumulate over 45 years of his life if he puts his will to the task.
He had no one to give his money to, I guess. No children, no wife and no friends that we knew of. I
remember I was driving back from some boring class at some boring community college when I got the
call. I was so <U+0093>estomaqu<e9><U+0094> (stomached?) I had to pull over on the highway, first of all because I had no
idea he had passed away or that he was even sick, second to ask the notary to repeat the amount he was 
53
All rights reserved <U+0096> www.FSComeau.com
reading to me. Up to that point, I myself had been drifting from a place to another, not unlike him, from a
formation in accounting that led me nowhere to some useless telemarketer job. The call, from his will
executor, changed my life completely.
With his legacy came one small letter, visibly scribbled quickly days before his death, if that, on a single
sheet of paper (loose translation):
<U+0093>Frank,
As a kid, I was told that life was a game. Now that I""m all grown up, I can tell you that life is indeed a
game; just not a very fun one.
R.<U+0094>
And that was it. A few months later, one or two court fights later (some family members tried to contest
the will, of course) and I was a rich man, my life forever changed. My first reaction was to want to place
half in an index fund and now that I look at it today, I can""t tell you how badly I wish I had done that. But
I didn""t and one of the biggest bad streak of my life would soon begin.
I wanted to trade. I had always wanted to trade and the world of daytrading seemed like a utopia to me. At
first, I had success. People might remember my big Apple bet a few years ago where I essentially made
$30,000 in under a week. Looking back at it today, much later, I regret winning that trade. Perhaps if I
had lost everything on that trade, it would have disgusted me from trading forever and I would still have
much of that $2.5M today. But I won, and I won for a good while, and it kept me going.
Then, I began to lose.
I lost $500,000 due to the oil crash in late 2014. I had a ton of Canadian stock (the TSX went down
something like 30% at some point) and many, many oil stocks. I made it all back in early 2015, then lost
it all again in the first six months of the year, plus another $500,000 for the rest of the year. I was
panicking, hardcore, as a million dollars is no small amount to lose, Canadian or American.
I lost $100,000 in one night to Brexit. Another $50,000 betting on Hillary. The summer of 2016
specifically was particularly cruel to me. People who were there will remember that I lost pretty much
every single time. I was tilting, because I knew I was making the right trades, yet losing time after time
after time. But I knew I had done it before and I knew, or at least thought, that I could do it again.
I lost on several failed investments, from a stupid fast-food restaurant I wanted to start (which I won""t
name) to an apartment building where I lost my shirt. I also lost a fortune at the casino, mostly on
blackjack (man, the swings I got) and certainly poker. At my worst, I lost $30,000 in a week playing
$5/$10 poker. I got absolutely horrific hands and I got so many bad beats I stopped counting them. Yeah.
54
All rights reserved <U+0096> www.FSComeau.com
So to make a short story, this brings us to today. From the original amount, I have $325,000 Canadian
left. I have a $100,000 personal loan at 8% (yeah), a $51,000 credit card debt accruing at 19% per year
and various debts ranging from 6 to 10%. Oh man I feel so dumb <U+0096> I could have paid the car I am driving
in cash, but somehow I ended up getting financing because<U+0085> Because.
If I liquidated all my positions and stopped trading today, yes, I could probably repay my debts. And then
what? I would have almost nothing left, nothing at all. My $2.5M would be gone forever and perhaps
most of my mental sanity along with it. What""s the point? Truth be told, at this point, I have really
nothing to lose. Worst case scenario, this yolo fails and I go bankrupt. If I'm going out, well, I'm going
out big. I'd rather take my chance to get my money back.
This is perhaps my last chance in life to <U+0093>hit it big,<U+0094> aka be someone. I won""t get another chance like this.
Look, I""ll be blunt: I want my two point five million back. It""s mine and I want it back, period. Unless
you""ve hit it big and lost it all, you don""t know how incredibly painful it is to look at $325,000 and think,
<U+0093>Yeah, this used to be 7 times higher.<U+0094>
And here comes the Yolo.
I began my career with Apple, I""m ending it with Apple. No matter what happens, this is going to be my
final Yolo. I""m sorry, I wish I could continue, but I""m tired of trading. It's morally and emotionally
exhausted and over the last two years, it's really taken a huge toll of my health, both mental and physical.
Some of you might have noticed the (subtle) changes in my personality and demeanors. It is time for me
to stop making a fool out of myself and stop suffering. I am tired of perpetually losing money. That
Google trade was the last straw. Even though I called the earnings perfectly, I still somehow lost money.
The stock market is rigged and I am done with it.
People who know me well know that I am an Apple expert. Without a doubt, Apple is my specialty. I
called the exact iPhones sales, revenues and estimates pretty much every quarter, and I can tell you Apple
is about to get a massive miss. Notice how there is no real <U+0093>hype<U+0094> around those earnings? That""s because
for the first time in, like, forever, Apple has failed majorly. They don""t want to foam around it because
they know very well it""s going to be catastrophic.
iPhone sales will be down 10-15% - and that will be the good part of their earnings report. iPads are
basically dead. The iPad pro is nothing more than a joke. It probably sold less than the Pixel. Okay, not
that bad, but trust me, iPad sales have been terrible for a while and this time, they""ll be so bad Apple
might actually throw in the towel. Truth be told, Apple is 2+ years late and 5+ years late in some sectors
when compared to the industry.
55
All rights reserved <U+0096> www.FSComeau.com
And apart from iPhone and iPads, What else does Apple has at this point? Mac sales are down, the iPod is
dead, the Apple Watch<U+0085> let""s not even mention the Apple Watch lol. What else does Apple have? iTunes
revenues? That""s like a billion dollars, who cares.
Look at recent tech earnings: Google, WDC, QCOM<U+0085> All freaking terrible! The entire sector is going
down and Apple, with its overpriced crap (it almost hurts me to write that) is at the forefront. An iPhone
is up to $ 1,400 here. I mean, like, what were they thinking?
I could go on and on explaining why Apple is going to crater after earnings. Basically, it almost always
does. Look at the past earnings: even when it did beat earnings estimates, it crashed afterwards. Apple is
just a very emotional stock and people like to mass sell it after earnings. And with how bad things are,
there is no chance in hell Apple will beat earnings.
Apple is not dead, but it""s going to slowly drift down into the abyss (See: Blackberry, Nokia, etc.). No
one can remain at the top forever and with so many companies producing phones, many of them far better
than the iPhone, it simply doesn""t stand a chance. I mean, the iPhone is like 65% of the profits. And this
brings me to my main points: the iPhone 7 is a fiasco. Worst, it is going against the VERY popular and
lucrative iPhone 6s (the <U+0093>S<U+0094> series always earns Apple more profits as the machines are already
calibrated) AND the strongest line of Android phones of all times.
Okay, name me ONE thing about the iPhone 7. Go! When you think iPhone 7, you think<U+0085>
<U+0085> no headphone jack. That""s it. The iPhone 7 has no headphone jack. I dare you to name me ONE thing
that is different with the iPhone 7 when compared to the 6s. Go. Without looking it up, even I couldn""t
find anything. And when your main selling point is a feature disappearing, it""s not good.
For the first time in like forever, it seems the iPhone had no hype at all. Perhaps everyone has one yet,
perhaps no one saw enough reason to upgrade (waiting for 7s?) or perhaps no one cared, but I can tell you
the iPhone 7 is an astounding failure. Oh, they sold tens of millions, but it""s plain and simply not enough.
Have you seen many people with an iPhone 7? Have you seen many people with an Apple Watch (which
has been turned into the subject of a mockery) Yeah, I thought so.
In simple words, Apple has lost it. It went from being a simple company with a simple product line to
some jammed messed. Everyone remembers the iPhone. There was ONE iPhone and one iPhone alone.
Now, there are something like 10 different iPhones available with so many options nobody knows what's
going on. iPhone 7, 6, 6 plus, 6s, 6s plus, Se... What the hell is that? And I'm not even speaking of the 20
different colors that make no sense. And just look at the Apple Watch and try to understand what's going
on: apple watch 2, apple watch Nike+, apple watch hermes, apple watch edition, apple watch 1...
Seriously what the heck is that thing?

Speaking of technology, Apple has fallen so far behind it's not funny anymore. The iPhone SE still comes
with 16GB!!! Sixteen GB!!!!! Is this some kind of joke? My operating system takes more than 16 GB!
How many minutes of video can you record with 16GB! Compare that to Android which often come with
SD cards and possibly terabytes of data and you've got a real joke on your hand. And almost every
Android phone outperforms the iPhone in every mark. The iPhone isn't even the top phone anywhere
anymore - it's gone, people!
All in all, we face the same problems we faced in 2012 when Apple""s stock crashed from $100 to $60:
dying business lines (iPod at the time) and no innovation at all. Apple was able to save face once, and
then again, not really: it underperformed the index from 2012 to today, only going up 20% in 5 years in a
period where the S&amp;P500 basically doubled. Tomorrow""s dreadful earnings will mark the end of Apple as
an innovative company as we know it. It will now be priced as a commodity company and this implies a
much, much lower valuation.
Google is still able to grow. Microsoft is still about to grow. Apple is about to report a sharp drop in
earnings, around 15-20% and perhaps as large as 25%, if they are honest (they can still fudge the number
somewhat). With much lower iPhone sales, it""s simply not possible for them to beat the very inflated
earnings estimates. This sharp drop in earnings, coupled with a terrible guidance for the rest of 2017
(strong USD, world tensions due to Trump, Apple failing in China <U+0096> all points I don""t have time to cover,
but which are very valid) will lead to Apple getting one of the biggest hits in the history of hits.
I""ll be blunt: Apple will drop 8-10% in afterhours (maybe more), it will open down 15% the next day and
end the day down more 20%. Yes, that""s how bad it is. And I""ll be there to earn a fortune from it. As I
said, I want my millions back.
My #Yolo is designed in a very specific way. It""s designed so that even if I am wrong (which I am not), I
will not lose money. Yep, it's that good. Before I try to explain it to you, let me explain this: I am 99.9%
certain AAPL is going to plummet post-earnings, but as there always is no way for me to know for sure.
There is so much market manipulation some banks might keep it from falling more than 2-3% just to be
able to liquidate their calls at the opening bell, etc. For this reason, I chose longer- expiration options as
Apple will most likely keep dropping in the days to follow (as more and more people realize Apple is the
next Blackberry and start selling their fund. People can""t liquidate a $2-3B position overnight). Thus, I
chose the monthly, February 17th expiration. Big manipulators might be able to manipulate the price
somewhat, but not very long.

I also made my trade voluntarily more complex to account for all possible scenarios (more on that later). I
have been screwed by big funds before and I have designed this trade so that even if I get screwed, I
won""t lose money.
So, without further ado, here is my yolo:
1) I bought $120 puts, twice the amount of $115 puts, 4 times the amount of $110 puts, 8 times the
amount of $105 puts and 16 times of $100 puts. Those are unbelievably cheap ATM. TOTAL COST:
$100,000 USD.
2) To cover the premium paid for those puts, I sold a massive amount of $120 calls. I used the entire
premium to buy the puts (and the calls below).
3) To be allowed to make that trade (margin requirement is crazy on naked calls), I bought a ton of $128
calls. This is a vertical spread which allows me to do the trade as I want it. Of course, there is no chance
AAPL is $128 after earnings, but without those calls, I would need a $2M+ cushion in margin, which I
don""t have (anymore). TOTAL CREDIT: $100,000 USD.
4) All in all, this trade has cost me nothing to do :D. That""s right: $0 upfront cost! Free!
5) To get the margin required for this trade, I had to sell all my long-term stocks and ALL my other plays.
Some of the margin is also taken from my Credit card but at this point, it doesn""t make a difference.
A 100K YOLO FOR 100K WSB SUBSCRIBERS! If you want to have fun, draw the payout that comes
from this strategy.
So, what will happen on earnings? Well, simply said: IT IS SIMPLY NOT POSSIBLE FOR APPLE TO
SPIKE UP POST-EARNINGS. It didn""t happen to Google, it didn""t happen to Western Digital,
Qualcomm or even Intel or Microsoft (2%! Yay!), despite excellent earnings (which Apple won""t have). 
58
All rights reserved <U+0096> www.FSComeau.com
Based on that, here are all the possible scenarios that could happen, ranked from worst to best, along with
what would happen to me:
1) The Google Gambit: Big funds play the <U+0093>oh they had one below average quarter but they are still
growing and they have huge product lines coming (yeah, right)<U+0094> <U+0096> stock miraculously only drops 1-2%
(like GOOG) is - I don""t make any money, but I don""t lose any either. I""m pissed off. Likelihood:&lt; 1%
2) The Qualcomm Quack: Apple somehow miraculously saves face by playing with
inventories/supplies/doing Valeant stuff. Then, the stock would drop only 3-4%. I would make a little bit
of money. Likelihood: 4%
3) The <U+0093>we barely got away with that one<U+0094> scenario: Apple cheats and starts buying its own iPhones to
prevent the number from crumbling too bad. It""s a bad quarter, but not too bad. Apple crashes to $118 in
AH and then drifts down to $115. I essentially double my money, a $100,000 gain. Likelihood: 20%
4) The <U+0093>last minute wildcard<U+0094> scenario: Apple somehow managed to earn more than I thought on some
miracle play (hedging). Earnings are down by quite a bit. Apple crashes to $115 and barely stays above
$110 in the next few trading sessions. I essentially quadruple my money, a $300,000 gain. Likelihood:
25%
5) The <U+0093>Back in the Basement<U+0094> Scenario: Apple is honest about its terrible quarter and results, but
downplays it and people somehow buy it. Apple crashes to $112 in AH and drifts down to $105 by Feb
17. I essentially sixtuple my money. A $500,000 gain. Likelihood:15%
6) The Meltdown Scenario Apple: is honest about its terrible quarter and investors aren""t dumb. They
mass sell the stock. It crumbles to $105 in AH and some idiots buy it thinking it""s a <U+0093>bargain.<U+0094> I make
over a million overnight and another $250,000 in the days that follow. It crashes to $95 by Feb 17.
*Likelihood: 25% *
7) The <U+0093>Hillary Clinton Scenario<U+0094>: It""s worse than I thought. Tim Cook apologizes and steps down, citing
personal problems. Apple plummets below $100 in AH. People panic, everyone wants to sell, it""s on the
top of every newspapers. It opens at $101 the next day, immediately gaps below $97 and then spiral down
to $90 where it belongs (maybe even lower, but let""s keep it at that). I more than fiftytuple my money,
making $5,000,000. *Likelihood: 10% *
So, what is the expected expectancy of that trade? it""s 1% * $0 + 4% * $15,000 + 20% * $100,000 + 25%
* $300,000 +15% * $500,000 + 25% * $1,150,000 + 10% *$5,000,000= $958,100.
Here""s a graph with possible payouts. The top column shows the price of apple, the leftmost row the gain
for each put (remember, $0 initial cost <U+0096> costs are covered):

Understand this: Apple WILL drop post-earnings. There is absolutely no way whatsoever it can go up. It
can""t happen. I mean, Google is down by quite a bit after its earnings, the entire tech sector is down, but
AAPL somehow stays at $122. Okay. I am hoping for a massive, massive, MASSIVE drop obviously. I
wouldn""t be satisfied with Apple dropping to $115, for example.
I expect to make close to a million from that trade, although there is a lot of possible variance. Obviously,
I wouldn""t be happy with the $100,000 scenario as this is my chance, and probably my last chance, to get
my money back. Note that even if apple doesn""t go below $100, my $100 strike puts will gain in value if
Apple drops to $109 post-earnings, so I might make a bit more there.
I want to thank everyone on /r/wsb for the continued and unending support. You have truly helped me get
to where I am and I just want to say that no matter what happens, I""ll have no regret. You have
entertained me during dark times in my life and quite possibly saved me. You guys never failed to make
me laugh with your puns, memes and other and for this, I especially thank you <U+0096> especially those who
were generous enough to become my patrons or get me reddit gold.
One final thing. I don""t know if God exists. I won""t pretend that I suddenly believe in Him (or Her), like
so many do in their time of need, but if you do exist God: please, please, please, please, please help me. I
have never been lucky in this life and you have thrown many obstacles in my way, but if you help me
here, everything is forgiven. It""s not that hard to break that $100 floor and once that happens, it""s game
over <U+0096> I""m rich. I know the earnings are going to suck. Don""t let big banks screw me once again.
If I do win, here is my promise:
1) I WILL repay all my debts, in full, immediately.
2) I WILL place half the money in a long-term fund that pays 4-5% per year. Banks, Telecoms, Pipelines,
etc.
3) I WILL use a quarter of the money to buy a house and plenty of nice things.
4) I WILL use the last quarter of the money to travel the world, enjoying life.
5) I SWEAR ON EVERYTHING THAT I AM AND EVERYTHING THAT I HAVE THAT I WILL
NEVER, EVER, EVER TRADE AGAIN.
In therapy, I was told that the most important thing was being honest with yourself. I""ll be honest with
yourself and also myself: I""m not a good trader. I""m so tired of losing. I wasted two years of my life on

this bullshit. No matter what happens, this is my last trade. After that, I am moving on and never, ever
even thinking about finance or stock ever again. Two years of perpetually losing money are enough for
me. But recently, I have been on a hot streak (100% success recently) and I just need the streak to last
one. last. time.
Verdict: Massively short AAPL through earnings.
AS LONG AS APPLE DOESN""T GO UP, I DO NOT LOSE MONEY. GLTA.

Quick update for those who asked (damn you, reddit formatting system! I'd short you if you had earnings
coming!) http://i.imgur.com/d0K2w9p.png
I am up by quite a bit, but commissiosn rekt me. Still, AAPL has begun its long decent into irrelevance.
Should be red every day now for a little while, as is the case every earnings season in the last 5 years.
Also, at the time of posting this, this post had a score of 666. Coincidence?
For those who asked, yes, I am serious. Some people have written to me trying to change my mind. I want
to say that I appreciate your concerns, advice and help, but that I am 100% dead serious about this. I have
spent a lot of time considering and analysing this and this is what I want to do; I have made my mind and
that nothing you can say or do will change it. Please do not write me telling me to stop this, I am stressed
enough as it is, believe me. I am holding this position through earnings and I am not going to change my
mind. I am ""pretty damn sure"" AAPL will crash massively following earnings and this is what I want to
do. Thank you.
Also, MODS=GODS.
Update #2: Quick explanation to visitors of /r/all who don't get what's going on.

Okay, so you have a stock. A stock is a portion of a company. If company ABC emitted 100 shares and
you had 10 shares, then you own 10% of ABC.
You can buy and sell shares. If you buy a share and it goes up - because other people are willing to pay
more for it - then you make money. If it goes down, you lose money. A stock will go up depending on
what people are ready to pay for it, but generally speaking, a good earnings report will kick the stock up.
Netflix reported good earnings, for instance, and the stock jumped 8%
In addition to stocks, you can also trade what is called options. An option gives you the option to buy or
sell the stock at a later times. There are two popular kind of options: calls and puts.
A call gives you the RIGHT, but not the obligation, to buy the stock at a fixed priced in the future with an
expiration date. The option stops existing after the expiration date (we say it is ""settled""). For instance,
Apple is currently at $122. A call with a strike of $120, expiring on February 17th, 2017, would give you
the right to buy AAPL (Apple's stock ticker) for the price of $120 at any time until February 17th, 2017.
If AAPL crashes to $115 tomorrow, you are not going to ""exercise"" your call. Why would you buy it for
$120 with your call when you can buy it on the open market for less? Similarly, if Apple goes up to $130,
then you would be able to buy it for $120 using your call and resell it for $130 immediately.
A put is the opposite of a call: it gives you the right to SELL at a fixed price. For instance, I bought $120
puts expiring on February 17th, 2017. This gives me the right the sell Apple for $120 at any time until
February 17th, 2017. Apple currently trades for $122, so I am not going to exercise my puts and sell them
for $120 since I can sell them on the general market for $120.
To be noted: you do not need to hold the shares to buy a put. If I exercised my puts today, I would end up
with a negative amount of shares of AAPL, which is called shorting (another topic).
I sold calls, meaning that I gave someone the right to BUY Apple shares from me at the price of $120.
Once again, I do not need to own shares to sell a call: if the guy exercised the call, I would end up with a
negative amount of shares.
Since AAPL is currently at $122, why doesn't he exercise his call right now, i.e. buying it from me at
$120 and selling immediately at $122? Because it can be shown (proved mathematically) that it is never
optimals to exercice a call nor a put before the expiration date, that is, February 17th, 2017.
Now, why would I give someone the right to do that? Because I get paid for it. An option has a premium,
which is the price you pay for that ""right"" (but, again, not the obligation). In other words, if AAPL was to
close under $120 on February 17th, 2017, I would get to keep the entire premium the guy paid me and he
would have nothing.
62
All rights reserved <U+0096> www.FSComeau.com
So my trade is as follows: I sold a mass amount of $120 calls. If AAPL crashes, those calls will not be
exerciced and I get to keep the entire premium.
Using that premium, I bought a mass amount of puts (remember, right to sell). This means that if AAPL
crashes, I get to exercice my puts and earn a lot of money. For instance, I have $120 puts that I paid $1.68
for; if AAPL dips to $110, I would earn $10-$1.68=$8.32.
Because I sold calls and used the money to buy puts, this trade has not cost me a penny. If AAPL crashes,
I could earn a lot. For instance, if it crashes at $80, I would earn $120-$80=$40 on my $120 strike put.
Each contract is for 100 stocks and I have 150 contract, so I would earn 15010040=$600,000. In other
words, if I am right and AAPL crashes after announcing its earnings, on January 31th at 4:00PM, I stand
to make a massive amount of money.
I also bought puts with a strike of $115, $110, $105 and $100. So if Apple dipped to $95, all my puts
would pay me ($120-$95, $115-$95, etc.). The more Apple crashes, the more I make. Ideally, AAPL
would go to $0 and I would earn the maximum amount ($120-$0, $115-$0, etc.)
Of course, you aren't forced to exercise your puts and you can resell them at any time. The price of the put
will go up as AAPL goes down. So if AAPL opens at $99, the $100 put would be worth $1-$5. The exact value depends on complicated mathematics and, overall, how much people are ready to pay for it.

And that's it. Hope it cleared things up a bit! See, options aren't hard =)

So on if comparing on yearly basis, revenues have declined the last 3 quarters.  Yet analysts estimate the revenues will reverse that trend and increase this quarter from last year. Why? Because the Iphone7 is such a game changer? Or because increased ""Apple Services""? I don't know anyone who uses Apple Music over Spotify. 

I think Revenues will be reported below $76B and AAPL will tank over the next 2 weeks, making FS a millionaire again.

1. This is the most lucrative quarter of the year due to the holiday shopping season.

2. Apple benefits from an additional 7 days of sales in this reported quarter (14 weeks vs the traditional 13 weeks), which happens because Apple realigns it's fiscal quarters every 5 weeks.

3. Because of #2, **Apple will post it's highest quarterly earnings EVER.** My guess is $78. billion. It's previous record is $75.9 billion, so I'm anticipating a $2 billion higher earnings than the previous record.

4. Apple likely has sold 77 million iPhones this quarter, which beats the y/y quarter by 2 million+ phones, which is also 

5. Mac sales should be up 6% over y/y quarter.

6. Apple Watch sales should be up 16% of y/y quarter.

7. Services should be up 20% over y/y quarter (revenue of ~$7 billion?)

8. Apple's future guidance will lead to growth in Q2 as well.

That #2 above is huge. An extra 7 days of sales is huge. Last call to get on the train and make some money this afternoon.

Hopefully I am not breaking any rules here. 

Through some fortune I've accumulated $23,951.58 in AAPL. Purchase prices ranging between $55 and $100 with the bulk purchased in the low $80s. 

My only other investments is my 401k. I've also got my cash emergency fund of 6 months salary. 

Here is my predicament: 
AAPL is doing really well now, on a large amount of shares I'm making over 100% return, but I'm not sure if I should sell? 

I know having all my eggs in one basket isn't ever smart but the way this came about was by opportunity rather than choice. 

If I sell, either a small or large share, what is the best move with the money? I've thought about 1/3 liquid investment (which would be? lol), 1/3 re-invest in tech (FB, Tesla, Google, etc? Whatever the smart stocks are), 1/3 a long term investment for retirement.

Part of my thinking is that, despite it being at something like a two year high, this is the year Apple's due to release some riskier, more exciting products (rather than further iterations of their core), so I can imagine some potential big games, but with their core products, not much risk for loss.

",AAPL strange trend.,,,,2022-01-31 11:10:03,investing,2017-02-22,2017-02-22,32.11108597008874,32.273489612286546,32.035770472951846,32.27113723754883
1061,1061,AAPL,5voqaq,linlaoda,58,10,"Below is my analysis of Apple (AAPL). As of 2/22/17 it is trading at $137.11 and has EPS of $8.31.


*Business outlook*: I believe that their business model faces significant headwinds. They distinguish themselves as a company by being able to sell the same product at a significant premium to their peers (this includes their smartphones, tablets, and computers). According to their financial reports, iPhones account for over 60% of their earnings. I believe that the smartphone industry as a whole is saturating, meaning there are less people out there needing to buy a smartphone, and further, that Apple is losing market share to their Android peers as other smartphone companies are consistently cranking out very, very solid products (Samsung, Google to name a few). I believe that within 5 years we will see severe margin compression as Apple struggles to attract new iPhone users and keep existing iPhone users. I believe in the future smartphones will all be very similar in performance and thus will be subject to a price war.


*Valuation*: Currently AAPL trades at a p/e of about 16.5. I believe that their earnings *may* be higher YOY 2017, but in the subsequent years will continue the downward trend seen in 2015-2016. Thus I personally do not consider them to be a growth play and any purchase in the security would be as a value play. For a company with a pessimistic earnings future, I view a p/e of 16.5 to be too high and provides a poor margin of safety.


*The good (or is it really that good?)*

1. Their Cash hoard: Yes, they have a lot of cash - about $240B according to their latest filings. However before we get too giddy about this, there are several obstacles in the way: there is no guarantee that Trump will be able to allow repatriation of foreign overseas cash (90% of AAPL<U+0092>s cash is overseas), and even if he did, we have no way of knowing if it<U+0092>ll be this year, the next year, or in 4 years, and even if it was this year, just how much is that cash worth? There are several ways to value cash on hand, the most generous being to directly discount it from market cap. Subtracting $240B from AAPL<U+0092>s market cap would put them at an adjusted p/e of 11. This is cheap, but not that cheap - especially if my bearish outlook on the smartphone industry comes to fruition. The reason this is considered an optimistic valuation of the cash is because they are more likely to use the cash to overpay for an acquisition than simply buy back stock.


2. Their 10th anniversary iPhone: I<U+0092>m sure it<U+0092>ll be amazing, actually I hope it will be (I<U+0092>m an apple user). However, these earnings will be short term as then they<U+0092>ll face the same challenges they faced 2015-2016: everyone would already have a great iPhone and would no need to upgrade. We can be wishful and hope that Wall Street only cares about 2017 and early 2018 earnings, but we should know better than that - Wall Street cares about future earnings more than anything else.


3. They might have something else down the pipeline: This is true, but there isn<U+0092>t evidence of this yet and thus I would rather not pay a premium for this - I<U+0092>d rather get this for free as part of the margin of safety.


*Is it a short?* Not quite, it is not majorly overvalued as of this point. Even if we assume that earnings drop 50%, they are still selling at a p/e near 30, which isn<U+0092>t overly pricy.


*At what price do I like it?*: I like AAPL &lt;$100. Because I do not believe in their long term earnings prospects, I require a larger than normal margin of safety. At $100, That would put them at a p/e of about 12, or an adjusted p/e of 6.5 (accounting for cash, using the optimistic estimation seen above) I think that at this price, it would make for a very good value play that can generate 30-40% median upside.

I've recently applied the algorithm to other stocks and found a few interesting patterns. I can run this on any stock you'd like, but to test interest, I figured I'd point out AAPL's recent pattern and see if it proves useful to anyone.

So here's the pattern:

If AAPL opens high/low, it tends to continue in that direction during the day. Thus, daytraders should buy AAPL when it opens high and short when AAPL opens low.

AAPL tends to pullback on the next day after we see this pattern. I.e., if AAPL had a strong day today, it will likely open low tomorrow.

Because I'm an idiot who did no research before selling, I sold right before their last quarterly report. I had read some articles that the iPhone 7 was doing poorly and I also didn't like the no headphone jack idea (now I kinda do like it). I sold it at $115.

Since then I've watched their stock rise to nearly $139. Because of my poor decision I lost out on a potential extra $864. Not a life changer but it just hurt my pride.

Apple has filed suit in federal court against various defendants, which includes Nokia and two of its subsidiaries. To start, the case is in its very early stages. To this date, Apple is the only party which has filed a pleading (a document stating your initial stance on the law suit). None of the defendants have filed an answer (another type of pleading) dictating which allegations they admit or deny in the Apple complaint. 

Regarding Nokia, Apple alleges that Nokia breached a contract and violated various section of the Sherman Act, which, in its most basic form, is a law meant to prevent monopolies. The contract which Apple claims was breached, actually does not have Apple as a party to it. The contract was between Nokia and some of the other defendants, but Apple alleges that it can bring a claim for breach because the contract affects them. 

The other defendants here are companies that make money by acquiring patents and litigating or licensing them--they are essentially patent trolls. Nokia entered into an agreement with these other defendants in which Nokia bought out their patents. Apple claims that Nokia is attempting to monopolize the market by acquiring all of these patents as Nokia would then have enforcement rights over a bunch of patents that Apple thinks it shouldn't. Apple claims that these patents would restrict their market. In response, Nokia has filed a bunch of patent infringement cases against Apple, which I will not get to as their are quite a few. Just know that Nokia is counter suing. 

On January 12, 2017, the Court gave the defendants until March 28th to respond to Apples complaint. None have done so thus far. My take on this whole thing, is that one of two things will happen. First, this case may go all the way through discovery (the evidence stages of the proceedings) and the court will make a ruling as to any remaining counts against Nokia--this would probably take a couple of years. Second, and what I think is more likely, is that Apple and Nokia will eventually settle to squash all of this beef. Last time they settled, Nokia ended up receiving ~$700M. If this were to settle, Nokia may agree to license patents to Apple in exchange for some $$$. I really don't see Nokia paying apple any money unless the the Court itself makes a ruling.

To be clear, I am not saying this is ""more likely than not,"" or that I would bet my house/yacht on it.  However, I believe this is more than simply a remote possibility, and I would even go so far as to say that if AAPL does a large cap acquisition in the next 2 years (which is a real possibility with its swollen balance sheet and slowing internal growth), NVDA will be the suitor.

In addition to the obvious synergies of acquiring a cutting edge semiconductor to reduce AAPL's reliance on INTC and others (and to put AAPL on the gaming radar screen), AAPL has been trying to squeeze its way (unsuccessfully) into the automotive and smart-vehicle integration market for more than 5 years.  With MBLY off the table and continued consolidation likely, NVDA would be the perfect way for AAPL to buy its way into the automotive market.  

There are only 3-4 tech companies that could pull off an acquisition of this size, and AAPL is by far the most likely of the bunch.  With corporate tax reform on the horizon this year or next, AAPL will be repatriating more than $100 billion in cash, and you can only buyback so many shares.  AAPL will be looking for ways to put that cash to work, and when they do, NVDA is going to be at the top of the M&amp;A short list. 

As the holder of long positions in both AAPL and NVDA, I think this combination would be a perfect cultural and business match, and would greatly increase the future prospects for both companies.

To exemplify, Fitbit is entirely focused on manufacturing wearable devices. Speaking of Fitbit, it is now at a low ebb with a price of $5.40 after a series of constant downfalls. Despite the fact that it isn't the perfect stock choice, it is one of the companies that contributes to fading Apple<U+0092>s monopoly. Under this circumstances, iWatch was utterly disappointing, selling 55% less in 2016 than the previous year. Furthermore, currently, it keeps the same negative tendency as well.

An alternative tech stock seems to be Sony (NYSE:  even more SNE) after the company<U+0092>s recent restructuring. Their main forte is PlayStation and video games market. Notwithstanding, in terms of risk, even more, danger. A more rational and hypothetically lucrative option appears to be the well reputed giant Google. With more devices and releases like Chromecast, it protrudes the market previously dominated by Apple.

Woz: Tesla, not Apple, will have the next tech moonshot

Commentary: Apple co-founder says he's betting on Tesla to be at the forefront of the next big thing. He says Elon Musk creates products to please himself.

When it comes to the next great tech breakthroughs, Steve Wozniak isn't betting on the company he founded.

Instead, he believes Tesla is at the forefront of anticipating the world to come.


In an interview with Bloomberg Canada, Woz explained that he believes Elon Musk will be behind the things no one has really thought of.

""I think Tesla is on the best direction right now,"" he said. ""They've put an awful lot of effort into very risky things.""

Woz said Musk anticipated things like electric cars, self-driving cars and the need for efficient transportation systems. He expressed admiration for Musk's Boring Company, which believes that digging holes beneath the surface will obviate traffic.


""I'm going to bet on Tesla,"" he said.

Why, though, is Tesla different? ""They started with a car -- the Tesla Model S -- that made little sense in engineering terms in how much you have to build for what price and what the market will be,"" he said

Why, then, did the Model S succeed? ""It fit one person's ideal of this will be the most beautiful, you know, a very beautiful, elegant and simple device to use,"" said Woz.

Apple reveals belief in reincarnation
Trump's iPhone reportedly has just one app: Twitter
Apple asks holdouts to switch to iPhone because, well, because
""It was really built for Elon's own life. What car would he like? And when things come from yourself, knowing what you'd like very much and being in control of it [...] that's when you get the best products,"" he explained.

Some might imagine that Woz had Steve Jobs' -- and his own -- attitude in mind when he chose Musk as the next standard-bearer. After all, Apple created the sorts of computers that no one thought even looked like computers. (Which was, of course, why real human beings gravitated toward them.)

Now, however, Woz didn't mention Apple as being in the vanguard of the next big thing. A clue to why emerged from his subsequent words.


""Look at the companies like Google and Facebook and Apple and Microsoft that changed the world -- and Tesla included. They usually came from young people. They didn't spring out of big businesses,"" he said.

Apple is now a very big business. Might Woz be slyly suggesting that Cupertino can't quite match the more cavalier creative nature of Musk? I think he just might.

I was away for some time, trying to get completely anally-raped by the CFA level 2 exam last saturday. I managed to walk away with only a slight limp. 

Anyway, going over some setups for the future:

**[AAPL](https://in.tradingview.com/x/BVMRCicd/)**

This is the same setup we discussed last time, the only difference is that our time series has changed. Our uptrend leg is a little longer, we'll need to be patient. The reduction in volume here is our key supporting indicator. What's also interesting here is that the RSI(above) and the CCI(below) are flattening out. Given these are relative indicators, there is definitely some divergence going on here. The ending of the Crab pattern usually has some drastic moves as discussed before, so we need to keep our SL a little higher than usual, around 5%. Entry point here is 161-164 for the short, SL around 170. T1 here is 132, T2 125.

**[GE](https://in.tradingview.com/x/dKIgAgo0/)**

This is another from last week. We see a confluence of two patterns, a butterfly and a bat. Below our B point in this formation, we observe a Bat Action Magnet Movement to the D point. Given that there are 2 patterns here, we should see some high conviction movement towards the 25 mark. Given our time series, this could end up hitting 25 in the July Series. Once we hit the 25 mark, we should see a strong uptick back up to the 29 mark or even higher. Let's track this for now. Volume and RSI not contributing here to our conviction but that's alright. 

Traders can enter for a short here, we have only one Target, that is 25.37. SL should be kept at 28.

**[XOM](https://in.tradingview.com/x/8S36u26u/)**

Exxon mobile is also exhibiting some bat movements. Traders can short here for a target of 74.5, SL is 82, the risk reward ratio here is not that great, but its a high conviction move.

Once we get to the D point, traders can enter at 74.36, SL 71.5. T1 is 83.84, T2 is 86. Risky traders can hold for 90. This looks like a juicy trade. 

Again, for our supporting indicators we are seeing a reduction in RSI and a lightening in Volume. The selling conviction might increase and since we are seeing a relatively longer red candle towrads the D point, it might come faster than anticipated.


**General Market**

No index analysis right now, but it goes without saying we are precariously perched. Given the time-series of these set-ups i imagine they might happen either at the very top(again) or during a correction. It's important to note that the levels should still hold however traders should be strict with their stops. 

Signs that a pattern is getting invalidated are various however two main ones revolve around high velocity movement/volatility around the D point, or a gap-up/gap-down. Stay away from trades that exhibit this behavior. In my experience at the end/near D points, key events just seem to happen. 

Happy to answer any questions.

It seems every couple years AAPL goes through this cycle.  Stock reaches all time high.  Then 6-9 months later it drops 30-40%.  The last 2 times this has happenned after a big iPhone release.

**In 2012 the stock hit an All time high of $100. Then in 2013 it tanked to $55**

**In 2015 the stock hit an All time high of $133. Then in 2016 it tanked to $90**

Could we see the same thing in 2017/2018?  Could AAPL hit $180 and then drop massively to $120 level?

There are couple things that may prevent this massive drop:

1. Wall Street trusts Tim Cook now.  He has proven his worth. Wall Street did not really trust Tim Cook to take over Jobs in 2012.

2. Apple services.  Wall Street loves services and hates hardware.  If services become a bigger and bigger part of the company (Apple services is already bigger than Facebook and Netflix combined) then Wall Street won't be as scared if the latest iPhone isn't a blockbuster.  In 2016 the iPhone 6s was not as big as Wall Street wanted (along with China weakness) and the stock tanked 30%.

As Apple prepares to launch a new line of iPhones next week, the company is selling another round of bonds to further fund share buybacks and dividends, reports Bloomberg. Apple plans to offer $5 billion of debt in four parts to raise cash for its current capital return program.
The iPhone maker is offering $5 billion of debt in four parts, after dropping a two-year floating rate component, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. The longest portion of the sale, a 30-year security, may yield 1.1 percentage points above Treasuries, down from initial talk of around 1.25 percentage points, said the person, who asked not to be identified because the deal is private.
In August, Apple CFO Luca Maestri said Apple had completed $222.9 billion of its $300 billion capital return program, which is set to last through 2019. That figure includes $158.5 billion in share repurchases. 

At the beginning of July Apple held over $261.5 billion in cash and marketable securities, but approximately 94 percent of that money is held overseas. It would cost Apple upwards of 35 percent in taxes to repatriate its overseas cash, so Apple uses debt markets to raise money more cheaply.

Technically, $180 is the top of the channel. $155 looks like the bottom of the channel, so buying at today's price of $158 is probably close to the cheapest call entry you can get before the announcement.

1) The price of the iPhone 8...AFTER heavy promotions from carriers (especially T-Mobile and Sprint, which will likely get more aggressive than usual.) After all, this will reflect the REAL cost of the phone to the consumer, not the expected $999 retail price.
2) Any hints about how well Apple is able to meet iPhone 8 supply. Now, Tim Cook isn't just gonna come out and say, ""Yo, we sorta fucked up the supply/demand projections on the 8,"" but if the 8 is limited to certain geographical regions or rolls out later than 9/22 (expected rollout of iPhone 7s and 7s Plus) then that likely means they're having trouble meeting supply.

&gt;Apple Has Something of a Lock on 3-D Sensing Against Android, Says Rosenblatt

&gt;Apple's patents on ""3-D sensing,"" and exclusive deals with suppliers such as Lumentum, may offer the company something of a lock on the technology of augmented reality, according to a report by Jun Zhang of Rosenblatt Securities.

&gt;Apple (AAPL) Tuesday introduced its iPhone X, and the Street is fascinated with the implications of ""augmented reality,<U+0094> including both <U+0093>Face ID,<U+0094> the feature that unlocks the phone, and the various applications that use the rear camera, for things like new kinds of video games.

&gt;Among those pondering Apple<U+0092>s augmented reality is Rosenblatt Securities<U+0092>s Jun Zhang, who today argues that Apple has something of a lock on the technology, which may create some barriers to competitors building phones using Alphabet<U+0092>s (GOOGL) Google<U+0092>s Android software.

&gt;Zhang, who rates Apple shares Neutral, speculates on the chips in both the front-facing camera of the iPhone X, the so-called TrueDepth camera, and also what may be in the rear camera of both the iPhone X and the iPhone 8, the cheaper iPhone that was announced on Tuesday as well.

&gt;Collectively, these chips and functions are referred to as <U+0093>3-D sensing.""

&gt;Zhang goes through several details of the <U+0093>flood illuminator<U+0094> and the <U+0093>dot projector<U+0094> components in the TrueDepth camera, which he expects to be supplied by Lumentum (LITE), Finisar (FNSR) and II-VI (IIVI). He then writes ""We also believe Apple has an exclusive agreement with Lumentum, Finisar, and II-VI on VCSEL+DOE structured lights and 100-300 VCSEL array formats,<U+0094> referring to the chips involved.

&gt;""This makes it difficult for Android smartphones to replicate Apple<U+0092>s 3D sensing model,<U+0094> asserts Zhang.

&gt;In addition to the TrueDepth camera, Zhang thinks that the rear camera contains a <U+0093>Time of Flight depth sensor<U+0094> provided by ST Micro (STM) to make possible augmented reality applications: ""We still believe STMicro has a depth sensor in the rear cameras of the iPhone 8 Plus and X models as we believe that is where high-power VCSEL lasers and IIVI is used.""

&gt;""Our industry research suggests that STM supplied an upgraded version of the depth sensor to Apple this year [<U+0085>] In our view, the ToF depth sensor is enough to support the AR camera combined with ARKit.""

&gt;It all comes down to patents, Zhang believes, which may be an obstacle to Android copying Apple<U+0092>s work:

&gt;Our research suggests that smartphone OEMs<U+0092> interest in 3D sensing has increased following the iPhone X announcement. For Android, we believe Orbbec is the matured 3D sensing solution, although perfor- mance is far below Apple. Nonetheless we expect Chinese OEMs to adopt this solution in the first half of 2018. However, because Apple has some patents in 3D sensing, we note that it has become increasingly diffi- cult for other players to develop the 3D sensing solutions with a similar combination of perfor- mance+accuracy+power consumption. We expect adoption ramp to be in late-2018. Our industry research suggests that many 3D sensing model suppliers are waiting for Lumentum's small packaging of the edge emitter laser solution.

&gt;Of note, Zhang also addresses what some believe was a failure of the Face ID function during the demonstration on Tuesday. Although Apple executive Craig Federighi appeared to struggle on stage to have the phone recognize him, Zhang writes that Face ID improves over time:

&gt;Investors were disappointed to see the Face ID demo fail on the first attempt on stage, but according to our understanding, the system has a self-learning function where the more a user uses Face ID, the more accurate the readings become. Overall, we are not concerned regarding this first time mishap.

&gt;For a different perspective on the Android prospects, see today's post about the upgrade of Qualcomm (QCOM) from Northland's Tom Sepenzis. Sepenzis thinks Qualcomm and Himax will have a promising business supplying the Android camp with an alternative approach to 3-D sensing.

&gt;Apple shares today are up $1.65, or 1%, at $159.95.

It is clear that the avocado market is in a bubble. The demand for avocados is at an all time high, and a meager harvest this year has shot avocado prices into the stratosphere. But nothing lasts forever. Prices of avocados are up 125% in 2017 alone. 2018 will see the prices back down to earth.

Seeing as the demand for avocados is higher than ever even with the prices being at all time highs, can we assume that when the prices go down, demand will go even higher?

1357,1357,AAPL,7nhc2r,InvestingLifeSavings,156,88,"Looking at AAPLs fundamentals and the pile of cash they are about to be sitting on due to the tax bill makes me think AAPL might be a good investment moving forward. The valuation is also excellent relative to other popular companies. Here's why I don't want to put my money in just yet.

The biggest risk I see is that 70% of Apple's revenue comes from iPhone sales. I think iPhones are great, in fact I'm typing this on my iPhone right now. The iPhone X is too expensive and there has been bad publicity surrounding iPhone batteries lately which could eat into their sales numbers. Selling at over $1000 is a deal breaker for me and I would strongly consider taking my business to Samsung if it was time for a new phone. I can only imagine other consumers must feel the same way.

Additionally, part of the reason the company is so profitable is because the profit margins on iPhones are huge at about 60%. Apple is clearly a master of marketing and maintaining a strong customer base. I worry that the next time there's an economic downturn, no one is going to be able to afford these luxury products and Apple will have to drastically lower its profit margins in order to stay competitive. Additionally, there may be new, cheap smartphones which may not be as powerful as an iPhone, but gets the job done. I'm thinking like how an amazon fire 7 for $50 is expected to compete with the Apple iPad for $300+. 

Lastly and least importantly, looking at the max history of the AAPL stock price charts shows that the company tends to fall out of favor for long periods of time every few years. I don't know much about technical analysis, but based on recent news it seems like the company could be at a turning point once again. 

I really do want to invest in this company based on the amount of cash they'll be sitting on for reinvestment, the amount of cash that continues pouring in, and the strength of the brand name, but for these reasons I feel like I shouldn't.

&gt;A leading activist investor and a pension fund are saying the smartphone maker needs to respond to what some see as a growing public-health crisis of youth phone addiction.

&gt;Jana Partners LLC and the California State Teachers<U+0092> Retirement System, or Calstrs, which control about $2 billion of Apple shares, sent a letter to Apple on Saturday urging it to develop new software tools that would help parents control and limit phone use more easily and to study the impact of overuse on mental health.

&gt;Some have raised concerns about increased rates in teen depression and suicide and worry that phones are replacing old-fashioned human interaction. It is part of a broader re-evaluation of the effects on society of technology companies such as Google and Amazon.com Inc. and social-media companies like Facebook Inc. and Snap chat owner Snap Inc., which are facing questions about their reach into everyday life.","Tech is going to be the Big Tobacco of our time, short $AAPL",,,,2022-01-31 18:58:12,wallstreetbets,2018-01-08,2018-01-08,41.5161018371582,41.81613085022863,41.41608853272252,41.5161018371582

note: **I have been wrong 3/4 last predictions so please inverse me**



**Cons**:

Let's start with the facts. Broadcom, TI and Qualcomm reported earnings stating that expectations for modems have tapered recently due to the iphone. Please see QCOM's latest transcript here:

https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-02-01/top-iphone-suppliers-warn-of-slower-sales-ahead-of-apple-results?utm_source=yahoo&amp;utm_medium=bd&amp;utm_campaign=headline&amp;cmpId=yhoo.headline&amp;yptr=yahoo

Samsung also gave cautious guidance to OLED for mobile for 2018. In their CC, Samsung reported **23%** lower revenue than guidance for OLED for mobile phones.

https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Companies/Poor-iPhone-X-sales-weigh-down-Samsung-s-Oct.-Dec.-results

Furthermore, China mobile sales were very weak as compared to other years.
https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/AC/MediaTek-expects-headwinds-in-China-mobile-market-in-2018





**Pros:**
1) 
The bloomberg article did not mention that Apple is now using intel modems (https://www.fool.com/investing/2018/01/31/apple-inc-may-have-wanted-to-use-intel-corps-modem.aspx). 
(https://www.macrumors.com/2017/12/01/qualcomm-iphone-x-still-faster-than-intel/)
In fact during intel's CC, they've reported a huge growth in their mobile business unit.

2) 
The Korean Won was very strong this quarter due to bank of korea raising rates and growing peace between North and South. This headwind can account for 5% of the 23% lower revenue in OLED for mobile. Furthermore, we don't know exactly how much of the OLED goes to Apple although Samsung has exclusive rights to make the OLEDs for the Iphone X. 

Cautious guidance can be explained by other OLED mfgs such as LG's.

Therefore, it is my conclusion that Iphone X sales (in units) have moderated about 10%, but not as bad as other analysts have predicted. However, in revenue ($ USD) due to the weak dollar, Apple may have in fact beaten guidance despite the lukewarm sales.  

3) 
Latest Foxconn sales have shown a huge increase in revenue. Mark Hibben (Seeking Alpha) attributes the growth to the Iphone X sales solely.
https://i.imgur.com/ZXL1b8o.png

4) Apple's services will grow by more than 20% YoY. This is where the real growth is coming from. http://www.valuewalk.com/2018/01/apple-siri-now-active-500m-devices/

5) Taxes and the 350B spending spree. This is self-explanatory. I believe that Apple has been using this quarter as an experimental period where they want to take the next GIANT leap in progress - just like what Mark Zuckerberg has done. They both know that they can get away with it - which is totally fair. Please see my previous post to cite for your research: 
https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/7txxw7/isnt_it_to_apples_benefit_to_lower_aapl_to/
   


6) Qorvo, an Apple supplier, has seen a bit weaker revenue but expects encouraging growth in later half of 2018:



7) TSMC reported 10nm revenue in the 2 consecutive quarters of 2.55E9  USD. Since virtually all 10nm goes to Apple at the moment, we see 2.55E9/($26 cost for A11)*1E-6 &lt;= (upper bound) 98M IPhone X sold. Although this is an upper bound, this is way way higher than the estimates calling for 15-20M.

*With Apple<U+0092>s softer holiday sell-through being well reported over the past several weeks and QRVO<U+0092>s stock already having declined about 20% from its highs in November, investors look to have already largely factored in QRVO<U+0092>s lighter guidance, with the company<U+0092>s shares remaining relatively flat in after-hours trading.
Also likely helping to support QRVO<U+0092>s share price is its indication of <U+0093>recent developments with mid/high-band PADs and Phase 6 design wins<U+0094>, which include mid/high-band and low-band integrated PAD modules.  The company also sampled a custom mid/high-band PAD to an additional tier-one smartphone OEM. These mid/high-band PAD are significant as it has been the lack of high-performance BAW filter shipments that have recently weighed on its gross margins, particularly as it previously earned a high volume low-band PAD design with its largest customer that used SAW filters instead of the firm<U+0092>s BAW designs.
Update: The stock has now staged quite an impressive turnaround, surging by $6.43, or almost 9%, at $78.20, and at one point almost 10% higher this evening. One thing that may be helping the company are remarks by management on the call that later this year, it expects to see the biggest-ever content gains in Apple products that it has ever seen for its wireless parts.**
https://www.barrons.com/articles/qorvo-stock-already-reflects-weak-apple-results-says-drexel-1517437350?mod=hp_RTA&amp;




**Conclusion**:  Analysts have been deceptively scooping your shares, and Apple is using this time to experiment and take the risks needed to still be innovative in an era where value and growth are perceived to not go hand in hand.

That public perception is really important when it comes to the actual stock price, in addition to the success of the company.  The other thing is that they really aren't in danger of anti-trust lawsuits because they just focus on selling their products which are the type of products that will always have competition due to the large amount of people who feel they can get more bang for their buck elsewhere.  I don't think that will change with them any time soon, either.  They're not trying to be too big to fail which also helps public perception.  This is where I worry about Amazon.  They are acquiring a lot of different companies in a lot of different areas.  While they do have competition in the individual areas they are involved in, they will pretty soon be in a class of their own as a whole company if they continue growing at this rate.  What will the next liberal president do about that?  Also, Apple doesn't seem to have the privacy concerns that Facebook has.

They have huge free cash flows and income and their services/cloud sector is currently underappreciated. I've actually been more of a Microsoft fanboy my whole life (I even work a .NET stack) but it's hard to deny that Apple is building a rock solid, diversified company where they used to just sell phones and second rate operating systems. Their YoY growth in cloud is an impressive development, and their ability to leverage their devices/OS with other forms of monetization like streaming is a godly advantage over 3rd parties fighting an uphill battle.

I ask this because I'm starting to get worried that $QQQ is being inflated by imposters like Netflix and that it's going to suffer hard in the event of a downturn, where Apple could weather the storm with their foundation. We all know Buffett has given Apple his stamp of approval but even that aside, the math checks out, and it seems like the stock is underappreciated despite their massive market cap.

1640,1640,AAPL,93jgrj,titanvest,16,19,"Apple posted strong fiscal Q3 results Tuesday, demonstrating the continued pricing power of the iPhone and the stickiness of the company's software &amp; services ecosystem. At the after-hours price on Tuesday, it reached $995 trillion in market cap and could shortly become the world's first $1 trillion public company.

The company grew its quarterly revenue and EPS by +17% and +40% year-over-year, in line with Wall Street estimates. Next quarter's guidance was also above estimates.

More important for Apple's future business and financial prospects is the complexion of that performance. Let's dive into how this quarter and management's guidance reflect Apple's two most fundamental moats: brand equity and network effects.

**First, on the hardware front:**

Many were hanging high hopes on Apple's flagship handset (the iPhone, which is 60% of Apple's revenue) and its climbing ASP. This quarter, the company delivered. The 41.3 million iPhones shipped during Q3 is basically flat from last year, but the average selling price of $724 is a notable jump. This bump is likely due to an increasing mix of the pricier iPhone X, which starts at $999.

Our main takeaway from this robust pricing growth is that Apple continues to improve its brand equity and expand its pricing power. In a world of ever-increasing selection of lower-priced Android phones and already-high Apple penetration, Apple is undoubtedly seeing its iPhone unit sales growth slow. But the company is building digital services and a suite of other gadgets around the device. Those newer businesses, along with higher price iPhones, are widening Apple's brand equity and supporting continued pricing power and revenue growth. And pricing power, as Buffett often puts it, is the ""holy grail"" in investing.

**Next, on the software front:**

Investors have been watching closely as Apple ups its software and services revenue -- a catch-all category that includes the App Store, Apple Care, Apple Pay, iTunes, and iCloud services. This segment has been outpacing iPhone revenue growth for several quarters.

Apple positively surprised with $9.55 billion in software and services revenue this quarter (+31% growth). We think there's still tremendous opportunity left for growth in this sticky, high-margin app/developer ecosystem. The reason (and the moat): network effects.

As Apple acquires more iPhone users from a hardware perspective, it grows the distribution channel through which app developers sell/offer their apps. This is great for developers because it widens their consumer audiences, and it's great for consumers because it widens the selection of apps, software and other services to make the smartphone experience more rich and engaging. As each side of the network grows in size, so does the value that each side of the network gets out of it.

CEO Tim Cook said in January 2017 that the company hoped to double services revenue to more than $14 billion per quarter by 2020. That's almost 50% higher than Apple's current sales for that segment. Oh and it's a much higher margin business than iPhones too (because it costs almost nothing to plug a new developer into the App Store ecosystem, vs. the hardware that goes into an iPhone).

**Finally, on the forward-looking guidance:**

Apple expects Q3 revenue to come between $60-62 billion (+23% growth), edging out Wall Street predictions of $59.5 billion.

Recall that the company's recent quarterly results have been weighed down by concerns that it has saturated the smartphone market, marking the end of the iPhone ""supercycle."" The next quarter (fiscal Q4) is when Apple typically introduces new iPhone models -- usually in mid-September. Therefore, Q4 guidance is arguably the most important operating forecast that management provides to investors to gauge how the business and its product cycles will fare.

The company's strong guidance today suggests that multiple new hardware devices are coming in the fall (up to three new iPhone models). Per Tim Cook, ""we are very excited about the products and services in our pipeline.""

**Takeaways:**

Overall, our thesis has become even stronger on Apple. Similar to Warren Buffett's investment case, we believe Apple is truly a consumer brand at heart (vs. a classic technology or hardware company). Steady-growing consumer brands not only warrant higher prices and profits over time, but they tend to command higher public market valuations (given the predictability and secular growth of their earnings) than the hardware companies (which tend to be more cyclical, harder to predict and more susceptible to commoditization/price erosion from competition). At only 14x P/E on Wall Street's 2019 earnings estimates, AAPL is still too cheap for a growing consumer brand with pricing power and network effects.",Our takeaway on AAPL Q3 results / outlook,,255339.0,,2022-01-31 09:20:00,stocks,2018-07-31,2018-07-31,45.67430416779138,46.11592556062752,45.44389093631936,45.67190170288086

As noted in in the article below, Apple customers are upgrading their phones less frequently and it's been noted that big quarters are often followed by slower than expected quarters.

Anyways as I was thinking (i have a degree in mathematics, so I know what Im talking about) that I could show you guys with proof that im not actually gay for liking a chick with a D ya feel So here's the dizzle.

Chicks with dicks is not always gay, lets get these strate . We can even prove it mathematically (like i said i have a degree). Lets create something called a strateness factor. We will define this number to be the followin (Pairs of boobs + # vajayjays) (Pairs of balls + # dongers) Thus if we input a straight intimate coupling we get (1 + 1) (1 + 1) Resulting in a value of 1. We'll call this default straiteness. As you can see, if you remove all woman, there would be a ZERO in the top. Thus, we can say a result of zero is 100% gay. If we remove all men, the value in the bottom is a zero, resulting in an undefined or infinite value. Thus we say exceptionally large value is lesbion. If we take just a solo transexumal MtF, we would have a pair of boobs, a pair of balls, and a single dingaling. If we input these values into the formulae above, our value is only one-half. Thus, it is not 100% gay. However, if we get into fictional material such as hentai - futanari - we can get farther away from 100% gay. A single futa would have a pair of balls, a single didgeridoo, a vagoo, and a pair of tig ol biddies. This results in a hyperfaggo geometric paraboloid which by conventional wisdom is not close in the realm of fago to a Boolean value of true.","Short AAPL, DD inside",,309706.0,,2022-01-31 18:58:12,wallstreetbets,2018-08-23,2018-08-23,51.69927604765025,52.27732747724967,51.68723629558321,51.90159606933594

OKOK for all the lovers of apple. I understand they have a huge cash flow, lots of cash on hand, first company to hit 1 trillion. Whatever. I think apple is going to start crashing in a hard way because of public perception. Apple is slowly transitioning from a products based model, to a service based model. Why are they doing this? Well now that phones cost more than a computer people are holding onto their phones longer (average of about 8 months). Along with this people are starting to notice that apple does not actually support their products at a reasonable price. Apple is constantly trying to sue 3rd party sources from repairing their devices because it is cutting into their profit. Regardless, I am not an apple hater, I personally think they make great products, but for the price, for the lack of support, and the constant bad media attention I keep seeing of them.

Apple's drop in iphone sales isn't a big deal. For any of you that took a microeconomics class you may remember elasticity of demand, this is a measure of how much the demand changes for a product when the price is changed. Iphones have a relatively inelastic demand, meaning that with a change in the price, the quantity demanded by consumers will not change as much.

EXAMPLE: Price increases 20%, demand will only decrease by 10%

The image is a graphical representation of this concept.

I'm sure that when Apple decided to increase their prices they had analysts examine sales data. They likely know what they're doing. And came to the conclusion that with a price increase they could increase their overall sales revenue. Their decision to no longer report unit sales was likely to prevent a drastic drop of $AAPL. The recent decline in $AAPL is an overreaction in my opinion, and when people realize this it will return to previous highs. PAPA BUFFET knows this and he ain't worried. I'm buying $AAPL calls til I'm out of money, then I'll take a loan and buy more. TENDIES INCOMING!!!!

TL;DR: Apple likely employs smart people, they wouldn't raise their prices without any sales analysis.",$AAPL DD Inside,DD,372719.0,,2022-01-31 18:58:12,wallstreetbets,2018-11-15,2018-11-15,45.53277767587564,46.39804349667694,45.17265193100661,46.2626953125
1882,1882,AAPL,9xhvbc,Thomaswms01,27,1,"Alright boys, AAPL is currently trading at what it was back in July. You know what that means? YOLO season. Given that Buffet just loaded up on some more shares and that most analysts are still bullish, I think 180-190 is the floor. Yeah, *past doesn't predict future performance*, I too have read an Econ book.

I've been playing with some options for the past few hours. Here are the plays I'm considering, feel free to lose money with me:

**CALLS**

Ahh, yes, calls. The preferred degenerate gambler<U+0092>s roll of the dice. This first play is for those of you with long term commitment issues and questionable taste in one night stands.

* BUY Nov 30th $192.50 Call (adjust position according to your preferred levels of masochism).

This one is so easy, even you can do it. AAPL gets back into 200s territory, you make money. The risk is if that doesn<U+0092>t happen in the next two weeks, you<U+0092>re fucked. If Tim has enough courage by December 1st, a share price of 200 at expiry with 30 contracts makes you about $10k less broke.

If you prefer holding options over long stock positions, this next play is for you. 

* BUY Jan 17th 2020 $200.00 Call (why don<U+0092>t you just buy shares?)

As long as AAPL makes expensive things people want, this play should work. If they at least get to their current ATH again by January of 2020, you pocket about $20k (assuming you have enough money now to buy 20 contracts). In my opinion, this an overpriced and boring play, but to each their own. 

**PUT SPREADS**

If you<U+0092>ve actually read this far, you might just be qualified enough to execute a put spread. 

Here<U+0092>s the play I<U+0092>m most likely going to execute tomorrow in tandem with a few calls.

* BUY 100 Nov 23rd $182.50 Put
* SELL 100 Nov 23rd $185.00 Put

Per [Optionsprofitcalculator.com](http://optionsprofitcalculator.com/) (I know it doesn<U+0092>t account for everything, but close enough):

Entry cost: $3700 (net credit)

Maximum risk: $21300 at a price of $182.50 at expiry

Maximum return: $3700 at a price of $193.50 on day 23rd Nov 2018

Breakevens at expiry: $184.60

The thing I like about this play is you can make $3.7k as long as the stock closes at or above 186 on November 24th. Sure, you could lose $21.3k if AAPL closes at 181.50 or lower, but AAPL dropped 13 points after earnings. If you can think of an event that would make AAPL drop 9 points in the next week, go ahead and buy puts.

If you<U+0092>re bullish on AAPL, but calls have done you dirty lately, this next strategy is for you.

* BUY 35 Nov 23rd $185.00 Put
* SELL 35 Nov 23rd $190.00 Put

Entry cost: $4830 (net credit)

Maximum risk: $12670 at a price of $185 at expiry

Maximum return: $4830 at a price of $190 at expiry

Breakevens at expiry: $188.60

As long as AAPL finished at or above 190, you make a little under 5k (not bad for twiddling your thumbs). This one doesn<U+0092>t have the nice padding that the last play had, so anything south of 188 and you<U+0092>re losing money as usual.

Really, I just wrote all this so I could feel like I had something to show for the past few hours of playing with numbers. If you found it useful/entertaining, I may do more of these in the future. The last song I listened to was Funky Duck by Vulfpeck. Let me know the name of the last song you listened to in the comments.

I'm actually happy that AAPL has drop 25%.  I actually would not mind it dropping down to $150.  Why?  Because at $233 it seemed to be running out of air and just running mainly on momentum/hype.

But more importantly a lower share price will allow AAPL to buy a ton of shares at great prices.  Apple has about $250 billion in cash.  Last year Apple generated $75 billion in free cash flow from operations.  The CFO has already announced that AAPL will go cash neutral. Meaning they will spend all their cash up to the amount of debt they carry. So the next 5 years Apple could buyback $400-$500 billion in stock.  

The longer the stock price is low, the more shares AAPL can buy.

1906,1906,AAPL,a3p6dy,streetsofrageTWO,49,1,"AAPL is my largest holding.

And I'm pretty jacked about Apple dropping 26% the last few months. 

Why?  Because I'm a long-term investor.  I hold my stocks 5-10 years or even more. I really don't care about short-term price fluctuations. I do care about long term value.  And for long term value it is better for Apple's share price to drop and remain 'undervalued' for months or even years.

Why?  

BUYBACK.

Right now AAPL is worth about $800 billion.  Apple has over $250 billion in cash right now. They generated $78 billion in free cash flow from operations last year.  The math is pretty simple.  In 4-5 years they can easily buyback HALF of the outstanding shares if the stock price remains low.

In the past because of tax law the cash balance was not very useful. But now Apple is free to spend 100% of their cash on buybacks/dividends.

It is very possible that in the next 10 years Apple could buyback 75% of the outstanding stock.  That is CRAZY.  

You can bet your ass that Apple is buying a ton of shares the last couple weeks. 

That is the great thing about owning AAPL right now.  If the stock drops, Apple will dollar cost average for YOU by buying back shares in your behalf.  Basically you are getting the benefit of dollar cost averaging or 'buying the dip' without risking any of your own capital.

1910,1910,AAPL,a5a3rf,DeathStarLineup,55,1,"AAPL is worth about $800 billion right now.  We've all seen the news about peak iPhone, China worries, ect.  All those are true. For me the bull case for AAPL comes down to one thing: BUYBACK.

With the new tax rules, Apple's cash is no longer stuck overseas. They have full access to the $250 billion in the bank without paying additional taxes. The Apple CFO already said they were committed to going cash flow neutral. In other words have enough cash to cover long term debt. As of last quarter Apple had about $125 billion in net cash.

Last year AAPL generated $77 billion in cash flow from operations. They paid $14 billion in dividends. Bottom line is Apple is generating mountain loads of cash and they will continue to generate $60-$75 billion in free cash flow from operations for many years.

Think Long Term.

Lets say worse case the share price stays flat or even drops another 10-20% the next year. Could easily happen. But that actually helps not hurts the bull case of buybacks. It means Apple has buyback more shares at cheaper prices.  

If Apple stays at about $800 billion market cap Apple should be able to buy a huge chunk of shares the next 10 years.

Apple has $150 billion in cash to buy shares right now.

Apple generated $77 billion in free cash flows from operations last year. Even if profits/sales stay flat or even drop 5%-10%, they would still be generating over $70 billion in cash a year.  Lets be conservative and say Apple uses $30 billion on dividends and investments a year. That leaves over $40 billion a year for buyback.

10 years x $40 billion = $400 billion + $125 billion in current cash.

Apple could buy 66% of the outstanding shares if the stock price remained flat. And over 70% if the stock dropped.  Apple could even get more aggressive and spend an additional $50 billion and just hold a larger debt/asset ratio.  They could buy 75% of outstanding shares.  And what if Apple actually grows revenue/profit?

If Apple buys 75% of its shares and the company's market cap is flat at $800 billion, the price of the shares will go up 400%.

Yes they are still the biggest tech giant and have taken an a beating *BUT* along with the ongoing bear market, shaky outlook for future of iPhone, and now on top of all that BENT IPADS, the beating is justified for the time being. This is the one that<U+0092>s shook me the most *Bent Ipads*. Come on Apple as a premium manufacturer of tech this is unacceptable and here is why:

Apple is a prestige hardware manufacturer. They were the most innovative in the early iPhone days (RIP Steve) but since then innovation has become marginal and so the focus has been on maintaining prestige with steady improvements. The new iPad which from specs is a beast but is being shipped out bent due to manufacturing. Apple has said in responses that it<U+0092>s in spec and the flatness on body is specified to 400 microns (0.015<U+0094>). They are phrasing these responses like that<U+0092>s a extremely tight flatness but honestly it<U+0092>s not that crazy, BUT it is still sufficient for something like the iPad. 

When a flatness is specified on a surface (.015 in case of Apple<U+0092>s iPad), it doesn<U+0092>t mean the body can vary by .015<U+0094>, it actually means the body can deviate **half** that! So the max deviation should be .0075 inches (about 2 sheets of printer paper).  The pictures people have been posting clearly seem to be more bent than that and therefore in my 20 minute research without owning an iPad, I think Apple is  bullshitting right now and is going to have to recall many iPads.  Whether they recall or not this is completely unacceptable from Apple.

Apple made $84 BILLION in revenue in one fucking quarter. 

Google pays billions to apple, about $9B annually, for licensing fees to keep Google as the main search engine on Safari. This counts as services revenue. 

Apple's wearables (watch, Air Pods, etc.) will soon bring in revenues equal to a Fortune 200 company. 

5G hardware coming in 2020. It's a hardware update, not software. People will have to get the new phone to get the faster speeds. 5G is probably bad for people, but it's really fast. If you don't know that, that's your fault. 

Apple is going cash neutral. That $120B in net cash is going straight to share buybacks, dividends, and capital expenditures. 

Services growth at 19% last quarter. 

EPS will be at $20 in about a few years. Do you know what that means? It means a $300 share price will get you a 15 PE. AMZN's PE? 96. 

You want innovation? Apple glasses are inevitable. If they work, they could make wearables a fucking Fortune 100 company. Think about that. 

Putting serious money into Apple car. Making serious strides, and a China spy recently tried to steal their plans.

Now look at AAPL first. They met their new target at earnings (the one they changed less than a month before and obviously they knew they'd hit) and now the stock is up over 10% since the initial reveal that everything sucks.

Now look at NVDA. They're just 2% from being right back where they were before they announced they were going to MISS BY OVER $500 MILLION DOLLARS. Let that sink in.

Apple<U+0092>s known to be [opening a new office in San Diego](https://www.10news.com/news/local-news/apple-to-add-more-jobs-at-new-san-diego-tech-hub) to work on modems. While most news outlets have been reporting this is in Qualcomm<U+0092>s backyard, it<U+0092>s also in Intel<U+0092>s backyard - Intel<U+0092>s modem division (iCDG) is based out of SD.

Now that [Intel is exiting the 5G smartphone business](https://newsroom.intel.com/news-releases/intel-modem-statement/), this allows Apple to swoop in and acquire the entire group, fast-tracking Apple<U+0092>s modem development. This deal with Qualcomm has bought Apple a six-year lifeline to develop their own modems, but six years may not be enough.

I<U+0092>m sure you<U+0092>re thinking <U+0093>six years is plenty of time to make their own!<U+0094> but modem development is not as simple as it sounds. Not only will Apple need to develop their own LTE/5G/NR modem, they will still need to support legacy RATs like 2G/3G/CDMA - not a trivial task. Why pour billions into R&amp;D to develop legacy tech, when they can just acquire? Intel<U+0092>s key customer has been Apple anyway, so both groups are familiar with working together and each other<U+0092>s methodology.

With Apple partnering with Qualcomm for the near future, but also trying to build their own modem, there<U+0091>s a risk for cross-contamination and more lawsuits, so acquiring Intel<U+0092>s modem division and operating them as their own unit would also alleviate these fears.

The only hiccup is Intel has specified they are only giving up *smartphone* 5G development. Would they be willing to give up their 5G IP even though they<U+0092>re still probably planning on putting 5G into laptops? Or will they come out and admit they<U+0092>re giving up on 5G modems all-together?

$AAPL relies on repeat sales of over-priced hardware to people that either:
(1) already own an iPhone and have no compelling need to upgrade.
(2) don<U+0092>t already own an iPhone and are perfectly content with cheaper products of arguably better/equal quality offered by Samsung/Google/etc, OR, are perfectly content paying small small fraction of price for Huawei/crapPhone/etc.

$AAPL faces tremendous risk from trade war with China that isn<U+0092>t going anywhere favorable prior to 2020 election.

$AAPL stock has been pumped and maintained from buybacks not revenue growth. Their latest positive earnings was an anomaly due to unexpectedly high sales from wearable hardware that are one-time purchase.

$AAPL core OS riddled with major security and privacy vulnerabilities caused by years of short-sighted feature-development. An unprecedented number of exploits have been quietly revealed for their core products each week this year and trend continues to increase/worsen.

$AAPL is at risk for significant anti competitive / antitrust regulatory action over their tight control of their App Store<U+0097> already lost in Supreme Court ruling 5-4 permitting legal action against Apple. This could not only decrease the margin on their <U+0091>services<U+0092> revenue stream, but may also introduce massive competition (not only from Spotify etc) but via 3rd apps siphoning core icloud services by the cloud giants (already permitted Chrome on their protected iOS webkit)

$AAPL <U+0091>s recent methods attempting to force users to purchase newer iPhones/computers (e.g. preventing 3rd party battery replacements or repairs, pushing out software updates to program performance degradation of older iPhone models, preventing older MacBooks from upgrading to latest OS, soldering computer parts to MB to prevent ability to upgrade, etc.) has upset many loyal customers. Most of their purported logic behind these methods are flimsy at best and unethical or nonsensical at worst. (E.G. Why should a base model dual-core 1.8GHz i5 4GB RAM mid-2012 MacBook Air be able to upgrade to latest MacOS <U+0097> but NOT a quad-core 2.4GHz i7 16GB RAM late 2011 MacBook Pro ?!?)  

$AAPL outlook signals poor. By diverting focus from their core business model offering *premium consumer electronics* instead venturing into forays such as software services, credit cards, audio/video content streaming, etc. reveals a lack of innovation, and signals that their market saturation has peaked.

I know there is also talk about 5G, but is that really expected to give them huge revenue growth from the average joe? 5G doesn't personally make me want to go rush and buy a new iPhone any faster than I usually would (maybe upgrade every 3-5 years), but maybe I am uneducated about 5G and what is to come.

To address the concerns: Apple going up 34% on the 3 month chart and 13% on the monthly is not a huge concern for me mainly because of these gains are supported by the integration and expansion of  Apple's service revenue and wearables (airpods/watches) revenue as part of it's core investment strategy. I think it's a healthy move to diversify and branch out from the flagship iPhone revenue which generates some 60% of it's revenue. Apple looks to be staging a great foundation for the development of the service platform which aims to help provide an insurance for customers at a relatively reasonable price ( which I assume will become even more affordable and therefore, profitable as they scale this area). Numbers in last fiscal quarter also suggest a growing revenue share in this area. As per the wearables technology, the watches are becoming increasingly adapted to the active lifestyle market, which is an attractive combination of both technology and sports. I don't see a big competitor in this space as Apple has already established such a strong foundation in this product and the dominance of it's competitors are disproportionately favorable for Apple.

On second thought, the airpods are also a great technology that they can expand on. Recently there is some buzz on earphones as a health product, by integrating technology that can monitor heart rate and blood pressure through the ear canal via the airpods.

For the past year Apple has been on a massive run with seemingly no sign of stopping. Analysts have been upping their price targets and managers who have missed out on the run are piling in. With Apple recently reporting earnings, there has been renewed debate about what price investors should be paying for stock in Apple.

\-High chance we go into recession if we aren't already there since companies have begun layoffs.

\-They still hold about 110 billion in cash, financially stable and can weather out the storm for years.

What are ""marketable securities""?

&gt;As we view these securities as available to support current operations, **we classify highly liquid securities with maturities beyond 12 months as current assets** under the caption marketable securities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  
&gt;  
&gt;Cash equivalents and marketable securities are comprised of time deposits, money market funds, highly liquid government bonds, corporate debt securities, mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities and marketable equity securities.

This time the cuts are much bigger (13-15% cut for Mar quarter, 15-20% cut for Jun quarter) now that there is greater visibility to the supply chain disruptions in China for much of the Mar quarter, as well as the demand pressures in China for most of the Mar quarter spreading to the rest of the world starting late Feb.

Analyst checks on global smartphone shipment data indicate a 38% y/y decline for Feb, which is the largest decline ever. Expectation now is that the demand pressures will persist in North America (US \~45% of sales) and Europe (\~25% of sales) for most of the Jun quarter as China begins to slowly recover. While Macs and iPads should arguably do better than iPhones in this environment of learn/work from home, technology purchases in general are currently far from consumers' top of mind.

AAPL has \~$100bn in net cash, generated \~$64b in free cash LTM, and has \~20x interest coverage ratio - it is as safe as any company can be in weathering this pandemic, not to mention its flexibility for buybacks.

EMAs are good. 14 and 25 are tight. the 14 day is close enough to candlesticks not to break meaning it can have a swift turn around or supported strength to go higher.

two main trend lines which are both support systems.

RSI has a 1 week straight RSI line-looking at a small correction maybe occurring( 2-3 days? MACD staying a little longer). 50 EMA passing under both 25 and 14. good news!!

everything as healthy as stated above. confirmation of correction. RSI at high of 67.35. MACD fast at 7.67. room to increase but not for a long period. Ichimoku cloud healthy and up trending. EMA healthy and uptrending. candlestick getting ahead of Tenkan. imminent correction.

My take. a bullish run is likely to occur long term, but im a bit skeptical as to how fast it goes up. especially between 330 and 340  which is a month trendline(resistance). a short correction will occur, daily 20 RSI line is too straight for my likening. with confirmation from 4hour 20 RSI heading higher and reaching peak 70. if it heads to 80+(4hour chart) then i see slightly bigger than expected correction, take that and add dividends. but stocks only go up.

Why do we care about technicals with this? It minimizes risk. First, we are in a downtrend, second, we are at the top (resistance) line, giving plenty of room to continue down.

So what, many stocks might be in the same situation as this one, why AAPL?

Well, AAPL has a huge exposure to China and the trade war - only giving steam to this downtrend. More importantly however, is that the NPC votes and reports on 28MAY in the evening (morning in the US for those of you who don't know time zone differences). You can check it out here: [https://npcobserver.com/2020/05/22/2020-npc-session-agenda-and-daily-schedule/](https://npcobserver.com/2020/05/22/2020-npc-session-agenda-and-daily-schedule/)

 He had utilized a stock broker  and I was to  meet  with him. 

I was on a bit of a  tear.  I had just gotten my liberal arts degree, and  thought  I was  super smart.  And in all the arrogance of a sure-fire smart <U+0093>kid<U+0094> coming out of a liberal arts school and still buzzing a bit from the dotcom boom,  I  learned that I could make my own trades for 29.95 using s new site called <U+0093>E*Trade<U+0094>.  I spoke to my Dad about it, he said, talk to  broker,  but if that<U+0092>s what you want to, do, it<U+0092>s  your money (sort of with the whole, I wouldn<U+0092>t do it, but go for it, I guess, attitude)

 I spoke to the broker for  the first time, and  after his pitch of  what the portfolio had done in the last five years and some  stocks I was going buy, it all sounded reasonable and good.  He seemed to know what he was talking about, but I still, in my  pushy arrogance of late adolescence , inquired how much I paid him per trade.  it  was considerably more than 30 dollars. I then asked if  I could make some suggestions  as to what we could buy.

More due to cost differential per trade than this vague analysis, I told him I think I<U+0092>m going to go my own way.   I put about 1200 bucks into Apple, some less into the online book store  <U+0093>amazon<U+0094>, and a couple of index funds,  and a few other companies, that I  thought had a lot interesting hype around them.

Sure enough, my apple investment looked horrible to start, losing about 40%  of  the value  within three months.  Same with Amazon.  I decided, though, to do nothing, and I was onto do different things.  I never  sold those shares, and today they<U+0092>ve are  pretty close to appreciating to  10,000%.  I bought Apple a few more times throughout my life, and that  one stock has accrued in value (I mean, all of it theoretical, I suppose, unless I do sell)  about the same for me  than my paychecks throughout my career.

Google says a stock split is a neutral event.  Bullshit.  No one rich does anything except for them and they boys goin' get richer.  Tim not-Cook-the-books says a 4:1 split will allow more people to participate in owning Apple stock.  This implies that he sees an advantage to an over-valued Titan class tech stock being easier to own by retail investors (compared to Google, Tesla, Amazon,... Berkshire Hathaway).  Let's get real.  Retail invest investors can already buy fractional shares on the easiest app to download onto an apple iphone.  Does he think that more people would ch0ose to buy AAPL over GOOGL or AMZN or MSFT or even NFLX?  Or that dumbass retail investors will think going from $100 --&gt; $120 is the same as running from $380 --&gt; $400?

In these instances, the post-split stock would quickly run up faster than pre-split, allowing Industry and Oligarchs to slip out the back door without crashing the retail party.  Then us bagholders wonder why AAPL can't climb above $125 for the next decade.

Speaking of Berkshire.  How much AAPL is coursing through Omaha's ground water?  Google says 245M shares (5.6%). Interesting. Vanguard Group owns 7.3% [and Vanguard owns 9.5% of itself, that means that Vanguard investors that own AAPL are double positioned on to AAPL].  No Ducking way these guys are pushing Tim Cook to help the small guys make money.

Assuming that V and BRK know the music is slowing down and they need someone to dance while they slip out the back, and assuming that a lower bar to entry means dumber, eager buyers, I present three scenarios:

1.  Stock runs up in anticipation of the split.  A future cheaper price means more investors will buy in after the split, effectively allowing current white collars to buy in bulk at a discount now over competing with the filthy wage earners later.  V and BRK start paring down their piggy bank.  Ease it out a few million shares a week.  Once we realize they are gone we just sit in a sideways party together.

2.  Stock is sideways to split.  Google says a stock split is neutral so nobody panics.  Inside their corner offices, V and BRK are shitting their pants.  What if retail doesn't show.  Trump might try to push off the elections and deploy BORTAC to quell transgender bathroom users in Arizona.  Retail is too busy with other shit to get a rise out of AAPL.  Once the split happens, V and BRK GTFO as the newest WSB boys show up to YOLO 5DTE $150 Calls.  Stock drops.  Theta gang has to payout $90 to own $80 stock.  Then they start selling $91 Calls, but WSB already YOLO'd.

#3.  AAPL runs up like #1, but then falls like #2.  Probably something to do with V and BRk earning statements coming out or they need to buy a shit ton of farmland from retirees right now and don't have time to tiptoe out the back.

To me, it seems impossible that AAPL drops back sub $400.  4:1, August (4x2 month) 24 (twentieth plus fourth day).  The numerology is there.  Not going below $400.  It also seems impossible to me that we will continue to see 83% annual gains for AAPL after the retail fuck-bois drive up the post split price.

I posited in an earlier post that the top investors at Apple pushed for the 4:1 split, expecting either retail bagholders or increased liquidity for options. (Maybe that last idea developed in the comments.)

Either way, Bank of America pissing on AAPL can't fit into Warren Buffet's master plan. So he doubled his position on BAC. I know the timing is a little off, and bank PE values are low making them a good long-run buy. But in this coincidence I have a theory that the analyst's rating will be adjusted to take into account some news happening in the next 10 days. What news? Anything. Because the new 25% owner doesn't want to see infighting.

Google has been lagging QQQ for a while now. I guess partly due to the ad cutting due to corona. But it also seems like their ad revenue growth has been decelerating for other reasons with a lot of players attacking the space from different angles (Amzn,TTD, Roku, FB, ramp etc).

 Their company culture is heavily based around engineering yet not so savvy when it comes to product marketing and expanding shareholder value. They come up with cool tech but seem to always be either too late or too early to the party. Google glasses didn't pan out, pixel phones are a modest success but not taking the industry by storm, google shopping is a money sink, Google fiber was curtailed, Fitbit acquisition is kind of iffy (Samsung/Garmin/Apple already dominate the space across respective demographics). They keep selling the AI future but Waymo seems to be the only thing they have going here that can turn out to be truly profitable. Will that be enough though?

Apple on the other hand knows how to drive share price. Always doing buybacks. Although they are historically a hardware focused company they are transitioning more and more into the services industry with their popular app store, Apple TV+, apple pay etc. Seems like this will be their long-term pivot.

With TSLA options post split, with obviously no historical split data and high volatility going into the split, why would IV crush not be a concern for September &amp; October calls?

TLDR: Historically, AAPL Options strong pre-split and weak post-split.

That gap feels large to me. Also, FB is valued at $760B with much lower revenue and decelerating growth, so its gap vs GOOG seems small. 

Is GOOG a good buy? Are these other companies just overvalued? Curious what you all think.  
Here's my thinking:

* GOOG has rock-solid fundamentals - excellent gross margins, has maintained \~15%+ YoY revenue growth even at their scale, and search is a steady business with many entrypoints across the Google ecosystem
* GOOG has bets across so many forward-looking industries that I think they will be able to diversify over time and don't have real risk of not continuing to innovate. There's of course the risk of anti-trust and privacy regulations, but that's been true for years now (although things do appear to be ratcheting up).
* It seems their stock hasn't mooned during covid because a meaningful share of search volume (and subsequently search revenue) comes from brick-and-mortar businesses (as opposed to someone like FB, whose ads biz is more of an ecommerce/direct-to-consumer play), which puts a drag on their revenue. This was the main reason for their relatively weak Q2 earnings a couple weeks back.

* TSLA obviously has been exploding this past week and AAPL growth has remained comparatively stunted. I've attributed these differences mainly to TSLA's seemingly endless stream of good news and AAPL's current bad news (the Epic battle &amp; now DOJ antitrust unit oversight) which is showing the result of many people choosing to place their money on TSLA which appears to be the better bet.

What intrigues me is that despite AAPL's negative press, it has still pushed substantially upward.. Could cautious investors have had a plan this whole time to ride the TSLA wave up all week and then bailout at the last minute, probably sometime tomorrow (possibly in after hours) and then pile funds hard into AAPL? It's price has proved pretty resilient to it's issues this week and currently I think it is comparatively undervalued to TSLA.....

\*AMZN is obviously an enormous stock and overdue for a split. They've also faced alot of inquiry and pressure about splitting now that AAPL &amp; TSLA have stepped up, and it seems likely that AMZN will because they would almost definitely greatly benefit from such a move.

I imagine most people will be frozen into their TSLAs &amp; AAPLs next week so as not to miss out on the split action. Amid this frenzy, could AMZN see tomorrow as a tactical time to announce a split of their own? With the right split ratio offered and time frame (buy in deadline Aug 28), they could easily get many investors to reassign their funds, which would simultaneously be striking blows against TSLA &amp; AAPL share prices and boosting AMZN's own.....

They<U+0092>re probably one of the best run companies in the world, evidenced by being the first US company to eclipse $2 trillion in market capitalization. With that said, I<U+0092>ve decided that barring anything unforeseen, this week will be the week that I exit Apple, and began selling at $507.87

Why? The simplest answer is I believe it<U+0092>s run up too far, too fast. Even a zero interest rate environment doesn<U+0092>t merit mature companies trading at 40 times earnings, which is where Apple appears to now be headed.

We have to remember that different companies come into and fall out of favor, and this last decade has been the <U+0093>Apple Decade<U+0094>. I believe with that so much of Apple<U+0092>s future sales are already priced into the stock, there really isn<U+0092>t much room for further growth. Even if it doesn<U+0092>t fall (I<U+0092>m not predicting a fall, but that could happen), the risk is a slowdown in the growth of its stock price as earnings slowly catch up.

The final nail in the coffin regarding my decision to sell is the crazy run-up its had since declaring its upcoming stock split. That day (July 30), AAPL opined at $376.85 and closed at $384.07. The stock has appreciated a full $120 per share in the days since that announcement, and while it posted solid earnings, I don<U+0092>t think enough has fundamentally changed to merit the recent rise in price. 

Please note that this post doesn<U+0092>t guarantee that I will exit Apple (especially if the price should fall), nor does it guarantee I won<U+0092>t repurchase it again at lower prices.

From Jan 2010 to Jan 2020, Visa V was growing with the slope of 22e\^\[(ln(95/11)/120)\*(t)\]. The past few months have been rough for the stock which is why we subtract 8 months from t in the tl;dr equation.

So I<U+0092>ve been balls deep in cruise/airlines/entertainment LEAPS all summer. Did I sell at the top of the last bull and realize the 10k I was up back on June 5th? Fuck no I didn<U+0092>t, I held that shit cuz I<U+0092>m retarded. So I watched it all sink into the red, but the last 2 weeks it<U+0092>s been slowly building and I see the next bull market coming on these stocks just like in early June, so here<U+0092>s what I expect to happen and what my plays will be;

Tech has been a safe haven for investments while other sectors are struggling, I expect after the splits of TSLA and AAPL on Monday they will have an initial bump and then they<U+0092>ll hit the top in the middle of the week on Tues or Weds and then there will be an aggressive pull out of people taking their gains and putting it into other things, namely cruises/airlines/entertainment

Tuesday: 
My play: selling all 4 (20) of my TSLA stock (yeah I<U+0092>m rich bitch) 
My recommended play: sell AAPL and TSLA, buy calls on airlines and cruises with an expiry 3 weeks to a month out

Rest of the week:
Watch my calls on AAL, CCL, RCL, NCLH, PLAY, UAL, DAL, LUV, BA bring in the tendies and sell out perfectly at the top. How will you know when the top is? Well what I<U+0092>ve learned about these spikes is there<U+0092>s a pretty constant build for about 3 weeks to a month. The first week or 2 are pretty slow (we are here), then the next week or 2 are pretty significant, then the last day there<U+0092>s an explosion, a huge increase markedly more than all the days preceding it and this when you want to sell because the next day will be bigly red. Learned this lesson in early June. So the play is to watch your calls for the next couple weeks and then sell when you see that explosion around 1:30-2pm that day and switch to puts and ride the train back down. Secure those tendies after a week or 2 then get back into tech and never touch cruises or airlines ever again. 

I expect the top of this airline/cruises bull to be somewhere in the 2nd week of September, my money is around Sept 10th-15th.

* They just got a whole lot cheaper and the average pleb will be all over that shit.
* People FOMO hard from the fuss.
* People have bugs in their algos and they haven't adjusted them for split. When the algos see a super low price they insta buy the fuck out of it.
* Big dogs double down because they have priced in stuff you can't begin to imagine. Oh, and everything is priced in.

* FDs just got cheaper and every retard can afford them. Time to gamble with lunch money.

&amp;#x200B;

**Bear reasons:**

* The average pleb thinks they've gotten enough tendies from Papa Musk and Tim Apple. They sell it all to lock in gains. Also, that's the 3rd eviction notice and they finally have to pay rent. They cash out.
* Fractional shares already exist for those who wanted cheap AAPL and TSLA. There is no need for the college kids to buy due to lower price.
* Broke af people with just 1 share see an opportunity for liquidity. Before the split, on the one hand, they wanted to lock in gains and on the other hand they didn't want to sell their only share of their biggest winner. Now they can sell part of their position.
* People are expecting them to drop, because they are overextended and we are in a dot com bubble. They sell in order to ""buy the dip"".
* Retard algos auto trigger from unusual activity and sell hard.
* Big dogs are expecting the dip and sell at open driving everything down even further.
* Stocks that split historically underperform initially.
* All the paper hands see a small initial dip for any of the above reasons and they sell off.

2882,2882,AAPL,ilj4zw,GeneralKibbles,41,1,"AAPL. Take a thorough look at the letters on this ticker. Apple just had a 4 for 1 split, so let's divide each letter of this ticker into 4.

This gives us A - A - P - L. What do you notice about these first two letters? I don't know about you but it's pretty obvious the double A's in the ticker represents AA batteries.

You may be thinking, ""How the fuck do double-A batteries have anything to do with the stock market?"" According to [Homesteady.com](https://homesteady.com/), ""Remote-controlled vehicles like cars, trucks, airplanes and bikes are also **battery**\-operated and often take **AA batteries**. Many electronic handheld games like slot machines, poker and solitaire will **require AA batteries** as well."" If you analyze this statement a bit more, it will start to become clear. It says ""cars, trucks"" This is a reference to Tesla, which has been by far the most iconic/hyped up company in the stock market for the past month. It also mentions ""slot machines, poker, and solitaire,"" all gambling games. This is also an obvious reference to the stock market and the way we trade options, as we all know this is a casino.

Now that we understand that the AA in the name of AAPL represents AA batteries, (which in turn references the stock market), we can get onto what the 'PL' means, which is much, much easier.

If AA batteries are a reference to the stock market, how does PL relate to the stock market? Easy. It is short for P&amp;L, or profit and loss statement, something all us gamblers have.

Putting the words altogether, we have, ""AA Batteries, P&amp;L"". AA Batteries have a +/- sign on each side so that us retards will be able to put our batteries in the wii remote correctly. The stock market also goes +/-, up or down. When the stock market goes up or down, our P&amp;L correlates, it changes and goes up or down.

Since we know that the ticker for AAPL is literally a big representation of the stock market as a whole, we can start making predictions. AA batteries are crucial in this DD, so I will be using them again. When you place batteries in your TV Remote or Wii remote or whatever, you have to place one in, then flip the battery and PUT the next one in. The signs of the batteries will always be opposite to the one directly across it. For example, if you place a battery in with the plus sign or '+' on top, the next battery will have a minus sign or '-' on top. The market right now is in the process of ""putting in the first battery"", and this battery has the plus sign or '+' on top. However, the ""next battery we place"" in the stock market will have a minus sign or a '-' on top, because we will have to flip it. This will mean the stock market will completely flip into a bear market.

You may be thinking, ""How do you know when the stock market will flip?"" A great question, but one that is very easy to answer. In our mention of AA Batteries, they charge toy cars and trucks, and tesla makes those. Tesla cars are also powered by batteries. An event called Tesla Battery Day is coming up on September 22. That is the date where the first '+' battery is done being placed, and when it will be time for the stock market to be flipped and have the '-' battery to be placed.

TL;DR

AAPL stands for ""AA Batteries, P&amp;L"", which is a direct reference to the stock market. The phrase, AA Batteries references Tesla, and the process of putting batteries in a device (place the first battery, then flip the sign and put the second one in) references how the stock market flips from positive (bull market) to negative (bear market). The next big flip will come during or after 9/22, as that is Tesla's Battery Day, which signifies a ""flip"" from the positive endless bull market we have been experiencing, to a devastating bear market.",DD: How AAPL's ticker shows us we will crash next month.,Shitpost,1457139.0,1.0,2022-01-31 18:58:12,wallstreetbets,2020-09-02,2020-09-02,135.94890493914994,136.33425264872787,125.48521976024888,129.83273315429688

I'm a noob when it comes to trading and options. Discovered this a few months ago, and have enjoyed plenty of gains because of all you retards. 

I wanted to talk about AAPL and see what the group feels about it. Since AAPL's been having these red days, I got in on the 120c's for November.  I know we have a few upcoming catalysts - 

1. iPad and Apple Watch event, which is coming soon apparently.
2. iPhone 12 launch event, which is apparently its first 5g phone, so that should be exciting.

TSLA was another stock that underwent the split, but I think AAPL has better fundamentals, and looking at their business model, I think they should still go up in the near future.

I suggested this as an earnings run-up play and we could now potentially play this similar to ORCL as mentioned above. Slightly OTM weekly calls at market open if the overall market sentiment is positive might be a viable option. These could be sold as early as end of day tomorrow.

- AAPL: Apple continued to sell-off today after yesterday bounce-back and has established itself as the QQQ momentum leader over the last days. Short-term calls or puts depending on market sentiment at open might be a viable trade.

- NKLA: Nikola might be the most overvalued company with a market cap &gt; $10B in the US market.

These are just few examples of the comments made during the APPL presentation. Well there's one thing I'd like to share with you guys. Believe it or not you can get some really really good info here. It's called.....  [https://Google.com](https://Google.com)  Yes. Shocking! A source where literally anything you want to know can be found. Believe it or not, it has been known for over a week that APPL would not be unveiling the new Iphone today. It took me 15 seconds to discover this highly classified info. 

AAPL sold off during most of the presentation and took a dump at the very end. But guess what. The dip was bought and it's still green on the day. Do people think APPL will just skip the Iphone this year? Obviously they're saving the best for last. The Iphone reveal should be in mid October. You know what that means? Another month of speculation and buy the rumor. The fact AAPL is still up on the day (at the time of writing this) is bullish. BTFD! 

If you panic sold your calls you made a mistake. AAPL is still trading at 16% below its ATH and will only go up from here. If you bought weeklies and are disappointed after today's event, Idk what to tell you, except do a 15 second DD next time and buy some NOV-JAN calls. Overall the presentation was not bad. People were just disappointed that there was no Iphone and possibly IGlasses. 

TLDR: Stonks only go up (especially AAPL). Buy some AAPL calls not too far OTM exp in Novemver-January. Want to play it very safe? Look at the prices on 2021 leaps. Look at the 09/17/2021 $150C. Low premium, good greeks, and nice volume.

I recently learned that my grandmother had been buying stocks for me and my other siblings since we were born. She didn<U+0092>t know much (neither do I lol), but would just buy whatever was promising or popular at the time. So I have an account now that is almost exclusively MSFT stock because that was on the rise at the time, and as it performed better she bought more.

I was planning to either save up and buy more stock in other sectors to diversify, or sell some of the MSFT stock and use that to buy other stock. 

My question is would it be a good move to sell off a chunk of that MSFT stock and put it in AAPL instead? I<U+0092>ve been hearing rumblings the past few weeks that Apple has something coming out soon called Apple-Fi that is apparently supposed to be groundbreaking (no idea how factual the information is though). 

I know it would just be taking it from one tech stock and putting it in another, but if this wifi anywhere through the air thing is actually real, it would probably boost Apple<U+0092>s stock a good bit, right? Also, it feels risky having almost entirely MSFT stock because you never know what could happen.

AAPL earnings 10/29. Expectations are high so this just bets on AAPL staying essentially where it is now and the return is 100%. Seems very reasonable.

""Yesterday, the House subcommittee on Antitrust released a 450-page report outlining anticompetitive threats posed by AAPL, AMZN, FB and GOOGL. Our key take-aways from the 45 AAPL pages include: a) dozens of complaints about AAPL (out of the 20mm app developers and 1.8mm apps in AAPL's App Store), with zero positives about AAPL's value to consumers or lifeimproving innovations; b) underscores AAPL's strong shareholder value proposition and finds fault with widely used business practices such as bundling; and c) most complaints about AAPL are biz judgments (they charge too much, they pre-load their apps, etc), and not easily fixable through regulation. Finally, because AAPL's core asset is access to nearly 1B of the wealthiest consumers, we do not expect this report to materially impact valuation.""

""Relating to key issues raised by the House report about AAPL, regulatory experts at Technology Policy Institute (TPI) believe:

1. ""The key regulatory question is whether Apple uses the App Store to systematically foreclose competition or engage in unfair or deceptive practices using quality control as an excuse. This question cannot be answered by claims of a few developers, whose particular apps may have been technically deficient, failed to meet some security standard, or whose apps were unfortunately harmed by legitimate changes in the App Store. ""
2. ""Determining whether Apple behaved anti-competitively when it pre-loads its owned 40 apps will involve considerations such as the difficulty of downloading and installing replacements for AAPL's pre-loaded apps (ie, none), the level of integration of AAPL's owned apps with its operating system, and any negative effects on innovation inside AAPL's app ecosystem.""
3. ""Whether Apple<U+0092>s app review policies are antitrust violations will hinge on how its policies affect the market and whether prosecutors can prove that the issues raised are not just disputes between large companies over how to distribute profits and protect user privacy/security. Not being able to pay for Netflix and Spotify within an app are not, by definition, harms. To prove harm, a plaintiff would have to demonstrate that their absence foreclosed access, thereby harming consumers.""

Just the fact that apple is gonna sell more and bring more money into the company, that alone should make its stock rise? right? I know that they received a big jump in price recently but they already experience the pullback. Today seemed like a great day for them to rise in price, but they fell? I know i cant just ask, why did it fall, cause if you could answer that then you would be stinking rich. So a better question would be how could a new launch cause their stock to fall, could this be an indication that they are overpriced even though they're an extremely good company?

A lot of you are disappointed in this new iPhone  presentation. As history shows AAPL's stock price usually drops the day of their new iPhone reveal. I really don't know what people were expecting but this iPhone launch is very bullish. It's the best one made in a while. The prices are great and the new subscription packages will help revenue. Everyone expected 5G and the leaks took away from any real surprises

**So why should I buy the dip?**

Let's take a quick look at the price action for the last 11 AAPL events 60 days after the iPhone reveal. In only 2 of those years AAPL's stock price saw a decline in those 60 days. The first instance was in 2012. The iPhone 5 did not meet investors expectations and this is seen to many as the worst iPhone release. The second instance was in 2016 for the iPhone SE release. So this iPhone was the  one of two phones released during the year. This was seen as the most affordable version released before the iPhone 7 6 months later. Many investors were waiting on the newer better model. On top of this AAPL also went an inventory correction related to the mismatch of the iPhone 6s and SE. 

Besides those events, AAPL's stock has mooned the 9 other times. For those 9 events AAPL sees an average of a 9% increase in stock price 60 days after the event. The two best years being in 2009 with a 16% increase and last year with a 17% increase. Now for those who are getting ready to comment ""bUt wAs a PaNdEmIc aNd EleCtIoNs PrIceD In"" please stfu. We know the pandemic won't affect it's stock price and the elections can swing in either direction. 11 AAPL events is a substantial sample size and with AAPL's new releases it is hard to see how it's price won't go up much higher.

**Other reasons to be bullish:**

Potential stimulus, New AAPL subscriptions, Wider range of iPhone models, Christmas around the corner, Tech is king, Becky, for you TA nerds current cup and handle, and of course Stonks only go up. 

 **How Should I play this?**

Don't buy anything shorter than 60 days exp. Jan calls are best to avoid theta burn and to let Christmas FOMO drive the price up. Jan calls with a strike of $125 or $130 look pretty good. High volume and very affordable premium. If you're feeling bullish and poor go for the $140C.

Before Q3 I had never purchased an Apple product, however, in Q3 I spent $1200 on Apple GOODS. As my previous spend on Apple was 0, this is an INFINITE increase. Therefore, if we assume I am a regular average Joe, Apple's revenue for Q3 will be INFINITELY higher than Q2.

The lack of fiscal first-quarter 2021 guidance from Apple means that investors and analysts don<U+0092>t get a hint at how Apple is projecting the sales performance of the iPhone 12, which went on sale in October. 


Apple stock dropped over 4% in extended trading.

<U+0093>If you look at the case count, the case counts are climbing in Western Europe. They<U+0092>re climbing in the United States. And so there<U+0092>s still a sufficient level of uncertainty out there<U+0085> we don<U+0092>t believe that<U+0092>s an environment to guide into,<U+0094> Apple CEO Tim Cook told CNBC<U+0092>s Josh Lipton. 

Apple hasn<U+0092>t offered guidance for the past two quarters because of uncertainty related to the Covid-19 pandemic. 

However, Cook said that he was optimistic about iPhone 12 sales for a number of reasons, including 5G support, carrier promotions, and a loyal install base, and said that <U+0093>initial data points are really quite good.<U+0094>

iPhone revenue was down over 16% from the same quarter last year and came up short against Wall street expectations. However, many investors and analysts are more focused on how the iPhone 12 will sell in the coming year. Apple<U+0092>s iPhones went on sale this year in October, and more models are planned for next month, meaning that sales from the new devices aren<U+0092>t counted in this quarter.

Revenue for Macs and iPads both exceeded analyst expectations, most likely driven by strong work-from-home trends during the pandemic. Apple drew attention to strong results in those categories last quarter, too. Overall, Mac revenue was up 29% year-over-year and iPad revenue rose 46% from the same quarter last year. 

Sales in China were a weak point for Apple. Sales in greater China, which includes Hong Kong and Taiwan, dropped to $7.95 billion from $11.13 billion a year before, over a 28% decrease.

<U+0093>A larger percentage of China revenue is made up of new iPhones. And so that<U+0092>s the reason the number for the total quarter started with a minus sign. But given what we see in the early going with the new iPhones, we<U+0092>re confident we<U+0092>ll grow in Q1,<U+0094> Cook told CNBC.

Apple released new Apple Watch Series 6 models that went on sale in September. The category that those devices are counted in for sales is called Wearables, Home, and Accessories, which came in slightly higher than expectations. The category also includes sales from headphones such as AirPods and Beats. Sales for the category were up over 20% on a year-over-year basis. 

Investors are always closely examining Apple<U+0092>s services business, which includes subscriptions like iCloud and Apple Music, fees from the App Store paid by app developers, and licensing revenue. Services revenue exceeded Wall Street expectations and grew 16% over last year.

These 3 Macs all share same chip, [Apple M1](https://www.apple.com/mac/m1/). So Apple is no longer putting Intel CPU in their new Mac product lines.

&amp;#x200B;

So you might wonder, how good is this chip?

&amp;#x200B;

Based on the leak (and official ones will be released in 2 days when people start receiving their macs), it appears that the new MacBook **Air** destroys the last year's top of the line MacBook **Pro** 16 inch's performance in benchmark, according to what is listed on Geekbench. It also means that Mac mini, which costs ($699) stumps all previous MBP's performances.

&amp;#x200B;

I see that this leap in performance is far greater than what AMD did when they first announced their Ryzen1,2,3 product lines in past few years, and I dare to say that we might be observing start of new era where Apple silicon for laptop computer will be dominating over Intel/AMD going forward for next few years, similar to how their *A* series silicon in iPhone started dominating over all other mobile chips in smartphones, and the gap has not been closing.

The new M1 chip's single core score of 1717 [outshines](https://browser.geekbench.com/processor-benchmarks) all of consumer level CPUs, and its multicore performance is similar to that of i7-9700k. You need to understand that TDP difference between these M1 and i7-9700k chips are huge. M1 runs with 10watt\~20watt TDP while i7-9700k has 95watt TDP .

In short, laptop processor M1 is doing much work with much less energy (less heat) than i7-9700k, which is a desktop processor, and that is how Apple was able to release new MacBook Air this year without any cooling fans. You can't imagine running Intel i7 cpu without cooling fan. This just shows tech level differences and how much Apple was able to achieve by spending on research with billions in their cash reserve.

The M1 chip, without need of any separate graphic card offers GPU performance similar to RX 570 or GTX 1060. The intel's counterpart onboard graphic chip, Intel UHD630, has much worse GPU performance than M1, and they are incomparable.

Apple will be working on improved version of M1 chip, (possibly known as M1X), so that they can put them into MacBook Pro 16inch product lines, and higher end version of Mac mini, and I foresee that to be much faster than any other laptop CPUs out in the wild today, and on par with high end desktop processors.

Of course, the shift in momentum in userbase or AAPL's stock price won't happen in a single day or in single month, just like how release of the first iPhone or Apple's first SoC A4 (which were great innovations at the time but were incomprehensible for many fund managers, as well as to Warren Buffet) at that time of release didn't pop AAPL's stock price 10x times in one day or one month.

However, I think AAPL will be gradually increase market share in laptop computer markets over time, and also be able to make more profits due to simpler logistic (They now only need to produce/maintain one M1 line compared to having to embed 11 different intel chips, and having to work with Intel), and possibly expand their influence over to the desktop computer as well in the future.

According to Forbes ( https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2020/11/11/why-apples-switch-from-intel-will-be-highly-lucrative/ ) Apple could save up to $110 per Laptop/Desktop. This is a significant amount of money per unit added back into Apple's bottom line.

And Apple says that Mac Laptops/Desktops make up roughly 9% of their net revenue ( https://www.apple.com/newsroom/pdfs/FY20_Q4_Consolidated_Financial_Statements.pdf )

So I'm no mathematician. But I do know that Apple's new line of computers is retailing for a very similar price to last generations Intel based lineup. In addition to money saving, these new Mac's also become more energy efficient, storage efficient, and performance efficient. And Intel based PC's (to my knowledge) can't compete with all 3 of these benefits at the same price point or form factor. 

So what does this Joe Shmoe think? I think this holiday season a lot of people are going to be getting new computer's and I think for the price and performance a good portion of those gifts will be Mac's. I think that this computer generation is going to make a statement. And I cannot wait for Apple's Q1 earnings report next year. Apple is expanding its profit margin and computer market share.

The report claims that Taiwanese manufacturers are preparing to ramp up for production of ""Apple Car"" components as early as the second quarter of next year, adding that Apple has been secretly testing dozens of prototype vehicles on the road in California. Apple received a permit from California's DMV to test self-driving vehicles in 2017, and it was spotted using Lexus SUVs rigged with LiDAR equipment that year.

Here<U+0092>s why: **

Dominating the electric vehicle market right now is far less important than hastening the transition to an electric automotive market. Every electric vehicle that comes out , Especially if an Apple vehicle comes out, normalizes the concept and reality of electric vehicles for the American consumer. It makes them more comfortable with it. Big brand names with consumer trust like the legacy auto manufacturers and Apple instill confidence in electric vehicle purchases for the average American.  

**Therefore, if tesla can retain the edge and remain the best electric vehicle manufactured at the lowest price, they stand up from facilitated American adoption of electrical transport.**

Currently, tesla enjoys that very same status. Tesla reigns supreme within the electric vehicle sector right now. I think that is likely to stay<U+0085> 

- The manufacturing advances they are making with the model Y (casting machine) and the cybertruck, (folding chassis) and The new battery design, which is designed in order to enable very cheap, mass manufacturing, are unlikely to be challenged by any electric vehicle competitor from a cost basis. Tesla is going to source its own raw materials for batteries for the most part, whereas their competitors are going to have to buy from third-party. 

- unlike other car companies, Tesla doesn<U+0092>t have entrenched unions, it doesn<U+0092>t have colossal amounts of debt, it doesn<U+0092>t have an entrenched dealership network opposed to electric vehicle adoption.

- unlike Apple and other electric vehicle start ups, tesla already has brand name recognition, a Pan-American repair and delivery network

- Tesla technology lead to pack right now. People have been saying for years that a Tesla killer was on the horizon. Currently not exists. Tesla had the first mover advantage of moving from a luxury, to semi luxury, to main stream car in order to facilitate their growth. Other companies don<U+0092>t have this luxury, they have to produce a car competitive with the model Y and the model3 immediately, but without the strong internal engineering capacity while having to source parts including batteries and components from third parties. 

**I genuinely don<U+0092>t see a path to success for competitors outside of smaller niche market like small transport, vans, traditional truck designs, that sort of thing. I think Tesla has such a lead at the moment, that they are in the process of juicing the most out of capital expenses, their technology is so far ahead in terms of efficiency and cost, that they absolutely stand to benefit from competitor vehicles.**

In fact, I think the worst case scenario is that the entire auto sector ignores Tesla and continues business as usual, not normalizing electric vehicle ownership and letting Tesla be lord of a little kingdom rather than a prominent player in the entire auto sector.

One thing you guys need to keep in mind is that the current share price is, obviously, directly tied to future sales estimates. I genuinely think these are conservative. If the transition to an electric car market is hastened for the majority of Americans, and test the remains number one, the current number projections are exceedingly low. Especially when you factor in the profit margin on Tesla insurance, full self driving subscription, among others.",AAPL EV is good for Tesla,DD,1731072.0,1.0,2022-01-31 18:58:12,wallstreetbets,2020-12-22,2020-12-22,130.26457051754838,133.03594954112972,128.32460067020122,130.5318145751953

Read until the end as I reveal my price target for Apple and also what I think will happen in the next couple of days, weeks &amp; months!**

**\~ Warning! Very Very Long Post\~**

Hello everyone! So, let<U+0092>s go over some of the latest news on Apple before moving on to some fundamental and technical analysis, predictions and my price target for the stock in the next years.

So, let<U+0092>s start with the [news](https://postimg.cc/Xrkwk6rP) that Apple will cut the App Store commission in half for small app developers starting in the next days, this will affect developers who earn less than $1M annually from the App Store Sales. This is likely to lead to a small decline in commission revenues for Apple as around 98% of the app developers will qualify for this tax reduction from 30% to 15%, but all these small developers only contribute to about 5% of the estimated $50B in annual revenues from the App Store, so that would be only a $1.25B loss for the company, that is less than half a % of the company<U+0092>s total net sales in the last fiscal year.

Also, these changes may lead to a potential long-term revenue boost, as it is likely this will lead to an increasing creation of apps which will generate more commissions in return.

Alongside this we also saw the company releasing the new MacBook<U+0092>s with their first in-house [chip](https://postimg.cc/vc39NF7x), which promises faster video and imaging processing [times](https://postimg.cc/CR5Fmj5V), with both [CPU](https://postimg.cc/Y4yLdrMd) and [GPU](https://postimg.cc/xJz8gLsd) performance up to 2 times faster than the latest PC laptop chip using just a fraction of the power consumption, with both of the macbooks promising big improvements in [battery](https://postimg.cc/1fp6y1rz) life. Apple is also [expected](https://postimg.cc/GHrtJ8vc) to roll out even more in-house chips in future products, as they have started the 2-year breakup with Intel chips.

We also saw Morgan Stanley [upgrading](https://postimg.cc/bZ5qMsSS) their base case to $191 at the end of November, as they have cited record lead times, supply chain forecasts and carriers demand as they expect that the company will sell around 270M iPhone in fiscal year 2021, that<U+0092>s 50M more than the consensus and almost 30M more than the previous estimate of Morgan Stanley, with an average selling price of 842$, 9% more than the base case, as people tend to chose the more expensive and high tech versions of the lineup in this new 5G cycle.

The 5G super-cycle, which I believe is on the way, and will continue in the next years, as 5G become more available worldwide, could still be the biggest thing coming right away for the company with 5G smartphones [expected](https://postimg.cc/LJptP88f) to surpass 4G sales by 2024, with the average sale price of the 5G phones also coming down, helping them become more popular. This will also be helped by the recent entry to the Indian [market](https://postimg.cc/7fV6BHNS), as India will probably become the world biggest country in the next decade, this could be a huge opportunity for Apple to start and take away market-share from their competitors like Samsung and Xiaomi which have the biggest market shares right now.

They also [released](https://postimg.cc/PpWhPy31) an update iPad Pro and an all-new iPad Air in September which will also boost sales in this work-from-home environment that will keep the demand very high for this kind of products, just like the Macs. Alongside the increasing demand from the Wearables, Home &amp; Accessories that include Air Pods, Apple TV, Apple Watch, and many more products.

But the biggest reasons I believe Apple is poised for continued growth, is primarily due to its services business, as they start to offer more and more services like the Apple ONE [BUNDLE](https://postimg.cc/4777MD3s), which include up to 6 services from (Apple Music, Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, Apple News+, the new Apple Fitness+ and the iCloud service) for a pretty reasonable price in my opinion [starting](https://postimg.cc/BLkDnqzj) from 15$ up to 30$/month, this could be a great option for families and even individuals who use their services a lot.

The latest services, [Fitness+](https://postimg.cc/cKV4KrsG) just launched in the past days, and is a direct competitor to the likes of Peloton, as the service is available on the iPhone, iPad or even Apple TV. This also makes consumers buy the Apple Watch which syncs to the other devices to show you different information. The Fitness+ app just on its own is 8$/month or 80$/year which is less expensive than Peloton subscription which charges 13$ or even traditional gyms like Planet Fitness at 10$/month.

I think this will be the fastest growing sector for the company, as this aligns with the new macro trends, as the world is moving more and more to a digital approach to almost everything as consumer preferences, with more &amp; more younger people reaching the point in life when they use these services start to align to this increasing digital approach.

We also shouldn<U+0092>t forget the Apple Card &amp; Apple Pay service among many others which also seem to gain from the move to digital &amp; contactless payments, as this has been accelerated due to the current situation in the past year.

And one last piece of [news](https://postimg.cc/k6BKCVTr), and the most recent one, is that Apple may have fast-tracked the Titan project. The Titan project is targeting a 2024 or 2025 push to develop an electric vehicle with advanced battery technologies, that will deliver significant increases in range at much lower costs than the current technologies while also offering self-driving capabilities.

It<U+0092>s reported they will not use the same technology as Tesla Full-Self-Driving feature, but will use LIDAR sensors, similar to those that we can find in the latest iPhone 12 PRO.

I think Apple can go 2 ways with this project, they can either use the huge amount of cash the company has to buy another car-maker like Ford, GM or any other car manufacturer expect Tesla and Toyota which do have a big market cap, so that they can fast-track the potential manufacturing of cars, or they can enter into a partnership with big companies like Tesla, Volkswagen or any other car marker to either produce cars or license their technology to this other car-makers which would ultimately and probably have higher margin-returns than the effective manufacturing of cars. Apple<U+0092>s current overall [gross margins](https://postimg.cc/ykv1mfVP) stand at 38% vs the 15% average of the world top 10 automakers by market cap, which is significantly lower.

But this Apple Car thing is so far out, and there are so many unknowns, I will not try to predict anything related to this until there is more clarity on the subject.

And last, before moving on to some predictions, here are some of the highlights that we heard from the latest investors conference meeting, as the CEO, Tim Cook [expressed](https://postimg.cc/TyhpLzgg) optimism ahead with the launch of many new products and services, especially the Home Pod Mini and the new 5G iPhones, as these new iPhones include new LIDAR scanners that greatly improve the camera capabilities, as the iPhone as seen very positive reviews. We also saw the Senior VP and CFO, Luca Maestri give us great [outlook](https://postimg.cc/DWDmqxPD) for the company as they expect the installed devices base to continue to growth despite already being at an all-time high as they have over 585M paid subscriptions on their platforms and expect this to surpass 600M by the end of 2020.

I also researched and found what products we can see in the near future, with the first half of [2021](https://postimg.cc/jCBQsXVM) bringing new iMacs, the AirPods3 and the iPad Pro, while in the [FALL](https://postimg.cc/8jVJKngg) event we will probably get the new iPhone 13 alongside the iPhone SE PLUS and the Watch Series 7 with more products coming [later](https://postimg.cc/GHc3s01t) in 2021 or that don<U+0092>t have an estimated release date like the Air Pods Pro, the Air Tags and the iPad Mini 6.

So, before even starting, you should now that I am bull on Apple but I am willing to hear other opinions so don<U+0092>t be afraid to leave a comment down below.

I have made some predictions based on the growth rate of the [company](https://postimg.cc/JHRDpPGQ), the latest plans announced by them and used some estimates. So, keep in mind this are only projections and are calculated by myself, this is not an investment advice and you should do your own research.

This are my 2025 projections for Apple, let<U+0092>s take a closer look at them, each on their own.

So, in term of revenues, Apple has 5 big sources of income, which saw an overall increase of 6% despite lagging sales in the iPhone. The biggest revenue is by far the iPhone right now with over $137B in revenue in the fiscal year ending in September. I expect to see the iPhone sales increasing in the next years, especially in 2021, with the new 5G iPhone creating a super-cycle for the [company](https://postimg.cc/XGfBKT7J), as most iPhone users, including myself here, as I will upgrade from my iPhone X, will switch to this new product. The iPhone sales have decreased in the last couple of years by 14% and 3% as a result of the product not having big improvements, as well as iPhone usually starting to last longer than previous models, so I expect to see a 12% increase in sales next year and a gradual decrease in the growth of sales as more people upgrade, ending with just a 5% growth in iPhone [sales](https://postimg.cc/V0wfRpr7) in 2025.

The next revenues stream is from the Mac, which has seen an increase in the past 2years, with revenues topping $28B this year after the huge demand from the work from home consumers. I [expect](https://postimg.cc/1405tm2b) this trend to continue as they plan to continue to launch better products and I can see the company having a similar growth next year before starting to decline slightly until 2025, also ending with a 5% growth.

The iPad is currently the smallest revenue stream for Apple but has also seen an increase in demand in the past 2 years with a 13% average increase in revenues. I also expect the iPad to continue to grow in the next couple of years, especially with the learn-from-home environment for kids, and even after this period ends, the transformation for learning will implicate more digital usage. I [expect](https://postimg.cc/5XKtVsT0) the iPad to see some similar growth to the Macs, especially with the latest generation also bringing a new iPad air to the market.

The 4th revenue stream and the fastest growing in the past 2 years, with an average growth of 33% are the wearables, home &amp; accessories revenues. This have topped $30B this year, as Apple has also just launched the Apple Watch series 6 and also feature other great products like Apple TV, the Air Pods the Home Pod and the Home Pod mini alongside other third-party accessories.

I gave this [revenue](https://postimg.cc/v4C4JQ4T) stream a growth of 20% starting next year with a gradual decrease to around 8% by 2025, as I believe this will become more &amp; more popular as they start to offer more vertical integration.

And last, but by no means least, the revenue stream that I expect to grow the most and the fastest is the revenue from the services that Apple offers. This includes revenues from Apple Care, Advertising, Cloud Services, Payment Services like Apple Card &amp; Apple Pay and of course the digital content which includes fees from the App Store alongside subscription-based income including the new Apple One Bundle and Apple Fitness+ alongside the already know Apple Arcade, Apple Music, Apple News+, Apple TV+ and hopefully I don<U+0092>t forget any others.

So, I [expect](https://postimg.cc/svV7mDWR) this to become the clear 2nd biggest revenue stream for Apple by 2025, as I expect this to grow more than 20% next year, mainly due to the Apple One Bundle and Apple Fitness+ followed up by a slightly decreasing growth, ending with a 10% increase in revenues in 2025.

I think this are fairly conservative base case scenarios for the revenues, as I expect them to continue to increase the [other](https://postimg.cc/1VFFgkxJ) revenue streams and not have such a large percentage of the revenues coming from the iPhone sales as you can see in this chart.

In terms of expenses, I pretty much kept the same margins as in previous years, with a 68% expense ratio on product sales \[ [iPhone](https://postimg.cc/JDZ7jMnD) / [iPad](https://postimg.cc/Wd14CB9C) / [Mac](https://postimg.cc/q6GkZw2p) / [WHA](https://postimg.cc/211q9q8g) \] and 35% expense ratio on [SERVICES](https://postimg.cc/8sdLLrjH), as this are way more lucrative.

In the past 3 years, the products [gross margin](https://postimg.cc/ykv1mfVP) was 32.7%, so I actually imply bigger expenses for the manufacturing and sales of products, as this is mostly impacted by the company<U+0092>s supplier<U+0092>s ability to make up for and demand, while for the services revenue, the gross margins for the last 3 years has been 63.5% on average, but I expect this to be more in-line with the 66% margin in this past year. So, if services manage to grow to about half the revenues from the iPhone, this will effectively double the gross revenues, as every buck gained in the service revenues account for 2$ in the product sales.

So, I expect the total [revenues](https://postimg.cc/sMjByQ2n) for Apple to increase from $274B in 2020 to over $440B by 2025, increasing by approximately 10%/year, while I will keep the expense ratio pretty much in-line and have them increasing by 11%/year, this would bring the total gross income for Apple to $177B, increasing mainly due to the services revenues as I said earlier. This growth is just above the 4year [average](https://postimg.cc/Tp8g83mS), and below the 2018 levels, which we might see again with this 5G super-cycle and explosive growth in the services revenue.

I also think the company will continue to invest in both Capital Expenditure and Operating expenses.

I think the operating expenses will remain pretty much in line with the [previous](https://postimg.cc/2qBCfrnc) years, as this number has increased by 1% [annually](https://postimg.cc/Fd5JL9v8) both in R&amp;D and SG&amp;A. So, I will keep the exact percentages from previous years, as I expect the revenue to increase, thus I don<U+0092>t see a big increase percentage wise. This would account for over $60B in operating expenses by 2025 and over $11B in Capital Expenditures by 2025, as I expect this to increase, mainly due to the possible EV developments or investments in self-driving capabilities alongside other manufacturing capabilities. You can see that the Capex [spending](https://postimg.cc/yDsRdpLy) has been decreasing in the past years with just over $8.8B in payments for business acquisitions and the other traditional Capex spending. Some people may use the cash generated by [investing](https://postimg.cc/Mn9nG6Mz) activities as Capex, but that is more unreliable. I also can see the Capex going back up, so I wanted to be safe and implied a 10% growth.

This money would account for over $73B in [expenses](https://postimg.cc/dZnY91K1) and would bring the profit for the company to almost $104B before interest and taxes.

Moving on, let<U+0092>s see what interest income and expenses the [company](https://postimg.cc/cgy0x2ms) has had in the past few years. We can see a decrease in interest expense in the past few years as the company has been paying off debt, but they have also been generating less money in this department, with an overall decrease in this department of more than 50% in the past year, way less than the amount from 2018. So, for safety reasons, I used a 10% decline in both income and expenses [related](https://postimg.cc/QKgtZhZG) to interest, while increasing the other losses by 10%/year.

This would bring the company pre-tax income to just over $104B in 2025.

Let<U+0092>s move on to taxes. I know the Federal income tax rate is 21% for the [company](https://postimg.cc/ykY39pq1), but the actual effective tax rate for the company was lower than 15% in the past year, mainly due to lower tax-rates on foreign earnings alongside tax-benefits and tax-settlements. The average effective tax rate has been just over 16% in the past 3 years, but with more and more of the revenues coming from outside the US, I think it<U+0092>s safe to say that the company will have around a 15% effective tax rate by 2025, this obviously if nothing major changes in tax policy around the world.

So, Apple would [have](https://postimg.cc/Wqc3ytKw) $88.6B in income after tax by 2025 and with the current outstanding shares standing at just under 17B, so I don<U+0092>t even account for the company probably continuing to do share buybacks, this would mean a $5.22 [future](https://postimg.cc/4YytCLwL) earnings/share. And with today<U+0092>s price for Apple just around 136$, that would mean to [company](https://postimg.cc/RNf1qH44) is trading at just over 26 times forward price to earnings.

I don<U+0092>t think Apple will ever trade at a discount again, with the current PE [standing](https://postimg.cc/RqwqHQ6s) at over 40, I believe this will eventually go down, probably to around 35, despite the increase in services revenue, which is highly valued by investors. I think we can see Apple trade somewhere near 35 [times](https://postimg.cc/5H98PKv2) P/E in 2025, especially if something big happens with the EV project, this could be even higher, just look at Tesla which trades at [insane](https://postimg.cc/sBZhxMk5) P/E. Of course, we also have to take into consideration the dividends that will be received from owning the stock, as Apple has started to pay dividends almost a decade ago and has 9 years of dividend growth, with a 10% annual rate of [growth](https://postimg.cc/CnbZMbD2) in the past 5 years. [Here](https://postimg.cc/7CLT1G8C) is the dividend growth history for the company, as I also went conservative on this [estimate](https://postimg.cc/Tp7LcjGr) and implied a 7% growth for the next 2 years, 6% for 2023 and 2024 and just 5% in 2025.

So [here](https://postimg.cc/R3PK21QQ) are my 3 price targets for the company, [including](https://postimg.cc/JHR8JXvv) dividends but not reinvested. My bear case scenario is that Apple will trade at almost 165$ which implies a [return](https://postimg.cc/jCYzWhd2) of over 21% by 2025, while my base case scenario would see Apple trading at 195$ with a return of capital of 43%. I will also make the bull case for Apple trading at 225$ by 2025 with dividends included, which would imply just over 65% in gains by then.

I think this is possible as Apple has also [continued](https://postimg.cc/fJj36jMt) to buy back shares of the company on a constant basis, as they continue to an impressive campaign with over $72B worth of common stock repurchased in 2020. They continue to buy back shares at a very fast pace, having repurchased over 1.3M shares in 2019 and 2018, while also issuing less stock every year.

So here is the full [spreadsheet](https://postimg.cc/Z995KrzL) that I have projected for Apple by 2025 and the breakdown of everything i estimated \[ [1](https://postimg.cc/jCT7qdZJ) / [2](https://postimg.cc/DmcbSkMp) \] , if you do have another opinion or a suggestion please leave a comment down below, I think I have been conservative in most of my projections, but feel free to give your opinion.

Keep in mind, these targets might sound ridiculous, but just [look](https://postimg.cc/V50nHCSn) at the growth Apple has had in the last 5years. The company has increased in value by more 400% in just the past 5years and is over 100.000% up since it started trading. So yes, the valuation is mad right now for the company. So, are you willing to bet against Apple?

The company also has pristine [financials](https://postimg.cc/LYcYMxqf), with more than $65B in total assets compared to total liabilities, and more than $38B in cash and cash equivalents.

So, what do I expect in the next couple of days, weeks and months for Apple?

Let<U+0092>s look at this [CHART](https://postimg.cc/7592T1c8), so starting with the stock split, Apple saw a correction within the September stock market pullback, in a buy the news &amp; sell the event, after a huge runup post-announcement of the stock split. The stock entered a consolidation period, and didn<U+0092>t have any big catalysts, especially with new iPhone lineup not being included in the Q4 results due to the late launch. The stock found some levels of resistance near the $120 levels that it struggled to get past but acted also as support after breaking them just before the recent news of the possible EV developments or self-driving-features to be licensed to other car manufacturers. After that news the stock spiked and has now reached the previous highs made before the stock split and is facing some resistance, if the stock pushes over $140 I think we can officially say that it broke the resistance at those levels and is not just a fake-out. But I think it<U+0092>s likely that the stock will consolidate between 122 and 135$ in the next weeks until the next iPhone sales and quarterly results are released, as the stock has entered overbought territory again with an RSI over 70, the first time since the stock split.

So, what would I do? Well, I own Apple stock, and I really believe this company will remain the biggest or one of the biggest in the future, so I would really add on any weakness that the stock shows before the next quarter earnings are released, as typically Q1 [earnings](https://postimg.cc/V5t0FPTF) are the best for the company due to increased holiday sales combined with the launch of new products. I think any entry below 130$ would be really nice to start and build a position or increase it if you already own the stock. As I believe Apple is one of the most stable stocks out there with large institutional [holders](https://postimg.cc/3kqG3XcK) like Vanguard, BlackRock and Berkshire owning over 900M shares each.

Read until the end as I reveal my price target for Apple and also what I think will happen in the next couple of days, weeks &amp; months!**

**\~ Warning! Very Very Long Post\~**

Hello everyone! So, let<U+0092>s go over some of the latest news on Apple before moving on to some fundamental and technical analysis, predictions and my price target for the stock in the next years.

So, let<U+0092>s start with the [news](https://postimg.cc/Xrkwk6rP) that Apple will cut the App Store commission in half for small app developers starting in the next days, this will affect developers who earn less than $1M annually from the App Store Sales. This is likely to lead to a small decline in commission revenues for Apple as around 98% of the app developers will qualify for this tax reduction from 30% to 15%, but all these small developers only contribute to about 5% of the estimated $50B in annual revenues from the App Store, so that would be only a $1.25B loss for the company, that is less than half a % of the company<U+0092>s total net sales in the last fiscal year.

Also, these changes may lead to a potential long-term revenue boost, as it is likely this will lead to an increasing creation of apps which will generate more commissions in return.

Alongside this we also saw the company releasing the new MacBook<U+0092>s with their first in-house [chip](https://postimg.cc/vc39NF7x), which promises faster video and imaging processing [times](https://postimg.cc/CR5Fmj5V), with both [CPU](https://postimg.cc/Y4yLdrMd) and [GPU](https://postimg.cc/xJz8gLsd) performance up to 2 times faster than the latest PC laptop chip using just a fraction of the power consumption, with both of the macbooks promising big improvements in [battery](https://postimg.cc/1fp6y1rz) life. Apple is also [expected](https://postimg.cc/GHrtJ8vc) to roll out even more in-house chips in future products, as they have started the 2-year breakup with Intel chips.

We also saw Morgan Stanley [upgrading](https://postimg.cc/bZ5qMsSS) their base case to $191 at the end of November, as they have cited record lead times, supply chain forecasts and carriers demand as they expect that the company will sell around 270M iPhone in fiscal year 2021, that<U+0092>s 50M more than the consensus and almost 30M more than the previous estimate of Morgan Stanley, with an average selling price of 842$, 9% more than the base case, as people tend to chose the more expensive and high tech versions of the lineup in this new 5G cycle.

The 5G super-cycle, which I believe is on the way, and will continue in the next years, as 5G become more available worldwide, could still be the biggest thing coming right away for the company with 5G smartphones [expected](https://postimg.cc/LJptP88f) to surpass 4G sales by 2024, with the average sale price of the 5G phones also coming down, helping them become more popular. This will also be helped by the recent entry to the Indian [market](https://postimg.cc/7fV6BHNS), as India will probably become the world biggest country in the next decade, this could be a huge opportunity for Apple to start and take away market-share from their competitors like Samsung and Xiaomi which have the biggest market shares right now.

They also [released](https://postimg.cc/PpWhPy31) an update iPad Pro and an all-new iPad Air in September which will also boost sales in this work-from-home environment that will keep the demand very high for this kind of products, just like the Macs. Alongside the increasing demand from the Wearables, Home &amp; Accessories that include Air Pods, Apple TV, Apple Watch, and many more products.

But the biggest reasons I believe Apple is poised for continued growth, is primarily due to its services business, as they start to offer more and more services like the Apple ONE [BUNDLE](https://postimg.cc/4777MD3s), which include up to 6 services from (Apple Music, Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, Apple News+, the new Apple Fitness+ and the iCloud service) for a pretty reasonable price in my opinion [starting](https://postimg.cc/BLkDnqzj) from 15$ up to 30$/month, this could be a great option for families and even individuals who use their services a lot.

The latest services, [Fitness+](https://postimg.cc/cKV4KrsG) just launched in the past days, and is a direct competitor to the likes of Peloton, as the service is available on the iPhone, iPad or even Apple TV. This also makes consumers buy the Apple Watch which syncs to the other devices to show you different information. The Fitness+ app just on its own is 8$/month or 80$/year which is less expensive than Peloton subscription which charges 13$ or even traditional gyms like Planet Fitness at 10$/month.

I think this will be the fastest growing sector for the company, as this aligns with the new macro trends, as the world is moving more and more to a digital approach to almost everything as consumer preferences, with more &amp; more younger people reaching the point in life when they use these services start to align to this increasing digital approach.

We also shouldn<U+0092>t forget the Apple Card &amp; Apple Pay service among many others which also seem to gain from the move to digital &amp; contactless payments, as this has been accelerated due to the current situation in the past year.

And one last piece of [news](https://postimg.cc/k6BKCVTr), and the most recent one, is that Apple may have fast-tracked the Titan project. The Titan project is targeting a 2024 or 2025 push to develop an electric vehicle with advanced battery technologies, that will deliver significant increases in range at much lower costs than the current technologies while also offering self-driving capabilities.

It<U+0092>s reported they will not use the same technology as Tesla Full-Self-Driving feature, but will use LIDAR sensors, similar to those that we can find in the latest iPhone 12 PRO.

I think Apple can go 2 ways with this project, they can either use the huge amount of cash the company has to buy another car-maker like Ford, GM or any other car manufacturer expect Tesla and Toyota which do have a big market cap, so that they can fast-track the potential manufacturing of cars, or they can enter into a partnership with big companies like Tesla, Volkswagen or any other car marker to either produce cars or license their technology to this other car-makers which would ultimately and probably have higher margin-returns than the effective manufacturing of cars. Apple<U+0092>s current overall [gross margins](https://postimg.cc/ykv1mfVP) stand at 38% vs the 15% average of the world top 10 automakers by market cap, which is significantly lower.

But this Apple Car thing is so far out, and there are so many unknowns, I will not try to predict anything related to this until there is more clarity on the subject.

And last, before moving on to some predictions, here are some of the highlights that we heard from the latest investors conference meeting, as the CEO, Tim Cook [expressed](https://postimg.cc/TyhpLzgg) optimism ahead with the launch of many new products and services, especially the Home Pod Mini and the new 5G iPhones, as these new iPhones include new LIDAR scanners that greatly improve the camera capabilities, as the iPhone as seen very positive reviews. We also saw the Senior VP and CFO, Luca Maestri give us great [outlook](https://postimg.cc/DWDmqxPD) for the company as they expect the installed devices base to continue to growth despite already being at an all-time high as they have over 585M paid subscriptions on their platforms and expect this to surpass 600M by the end of 2020.

I also researched and found what products we can see in the near future, with the first half of [2021](https://postimg.cc/jCBQsXVM) bringing new iMacs, the AirPods3 and the iPad Pro, while in the [FALL](https://postimg.cc/8jVJKngg) event we will probably get the new iPhone 13 alongside the iPhone SE PLUS and the Watch Series 7 with more products coming [later](https://postimg.cc/GHc3s01t) in 2021 or that don<U+0092>t have an estimated release date like the Air Pods Pro, the Air Tags and the iPad Mini 6.

So, before even starting, you should now that I am bull on Apple but I am willing to hear other opinions so don<U+0092>t be afraid to leave a comment down below.

I have made some predictions based on the growth rate of the [company](https://postimg.cc/JHRDpPGQ), the latest plans announced by them and used some estimates. So, keep in mind this are only projections and are calculated by myself, this is not an investment advice and you should do your own research.

This are my 2025 projections for Apple, let<U+0092>s take a closer look at them, each on their own.

So, in term of revenues, Apple has 5 big sources of income, which saw an overall increase of 6% despite lagging sales in the iPhone. The biggest revenue is by far the iPhone right now with over $137B in revenue in the fiscal year ending in September. I expect to see the iPhone sales increasing in the next years, especially in 2021, with the new 5G iPhone creating a super-cycle for the [company](https://postimg.cc/XGfBKT7J), as most iPhone users, including myself here, as I will upgrade from my iPhone X, will switch to this new product. The iPhone sales have decreased in the last couple of years by 14% and 3% as a result of the product not having big improvements, as well as iPhone usually starting to last longer than previous models, so I expect to see a 12% increase in sales next year and a gradual decrease in the growth of sales as more people upgrade, ending with just a 5% growth in iPhone [sales](https://postimg.cc/V0wfRpr7) in 2025.

The next revenues stream is from the Mac, which has seen an increase in the past 2years, with revenues topping $28B this year after the huge demand from the work from home consumers. I [expect](https://postimg.cc/1405tm2b) this trend to continue as they plan to continue to launch better products and I can see the company having a similar growth next year before starting to decline slightly until 2025, also ending with a 5% growth.

The iPad is currently the smallest revenue stream for Apple but has also seen an increase in demand in the past 2 years with a 13% average increase in revenues. I also expect the iPad to continue to grow in the next couple of years, especially with the learn-from-home environment for kids, and even after this period ends, the transformation for learning will implicate more digital usage. I [expect](https://postimg.cc/5XKtVsT0) the iPad to see some similar growth to the Macs, especially with the latest generation also bringing a new iPad air to the market.

The 4th revenue stream and the fastest growing in the past 2 years, with an average growth of 33% are the wearables, home &amp; accessories revenues. This have topped $30B this year, as Apple has also just launched the Apple Watch series 6 and also feature other great products like Apple TV, the Air Pods the Home Pod and the Home Pod mini alongside other third-party accessories.

I gave this [revenue](https://postimg.cc/v4C4JQ4T) stream a growth of 20% starting next year with a gradual decrease to around 8% by 2025, as I believe this will become more &amp; more popular as they start to offer more vertical integration.

And last, but by no means least, the revenue stream that I expect to grow the most and the fastest is the revenue from the services that Apple offers. This includes revenues from Apple Care, Advertising, Cloud Services, Payment Services like Apple Card &amp; Apple Pay and of course the digital content which includes fees from the App Store alongside subscription-based income including the new Apple One Bundle and Apple Fitness+ alongside the already know Apple Arcade, Apple Music, Apple News+, Apple TV+ and hopefully I don<U+0092>t forget any others.

So, I [expect](https://postimg.cc/svV7mDWR) this to become the clear 2nd biggest revenue stream for Apple by 2025, as I expect this to grow more than 20% next year, mainly due to the Apple One Bundle and Apple Fitness+ followed up by a slightly decreasing growth, ending with a 10% increase in revenues in 2025.

I think this are fairly conservative base case scenarios for the revenues, as I expect them to continue to increase the [other](https://postimg.cc/1VFFgkxJ) revenue streams and not have such a large percentage of the revenues coming from the iPhone sales as you can see in this chart.

In terms of expenses, I pretty much kept the same margins as in previous years, with a 68% expense ratio on product sales \[ [iPhone](https://postimg.cc/JDZ7jMnD) / [iPad](https://postimg.cc/Wd14CB9C) / [Mac](https://postimg.cc/q6GkZw2p) / [WHA](https://postimg.cc/211q9q8g) \] and 35% expense ratio on [SERVICES](https://postimg.cc/8sdLLrjH), as this are way more lucrative.

In the past 3 years, the products [gross margin](https://postimg.cc/ykv1mfVP) was 32.7%, so I actually imply bigger expenses for the manufacturing and sales of products, as this is mostly impacted by the company<U+0092>s supplier<U+0092>s ability to make up for and demand, while for the services revenue, the gross margins for the last 3 years has been 63.5% on average, but I expect this to be more in-line with the 66% margin in this past year. So, if services manage to grow to about half the revenues from the iPhone, this will effectively double the gross revenues, as every buck gained in the service revenues account for 2$ in the product sales.

So, I expect the total [revenues](https://postimg.cc/sMjByQ2n) for Apple to increase from $274B in 2020 to over $440B by 2025, increasing by approximately 10%/year, while I will keep the expense ratio pretty much in-line and have them increasing by 11%/year, this would bring the total gross income for Apple to $177B, increasing mainly due to the services revenues as I said earlier. This growth is just above the 4year [average](https://postimg.cc/Tp8g83mS), and below the 2018 levels, which we might see again with this 5G super-cycle and explosive growth in the services revenue.

I also think the company will continue to invest in both Capital Expenditure and Operating expenses.

I think the operating expenses will remain pretty much in line with the [previous](https://postimg.cc/2qBCfrnc) years, as this number has increased by 1% [annually](https://postimg.cc/Fd5JL9v8) both in R&amp;D and SG&amp;A. So, I will keep the exact percentages from previous years, as I expect the revenue to increase, thus I don<U+0092>t see a big increase percentage wise. This would account for over $60B in operating expenses by 2025 and over $11B in Capital Expenditures by 2025, as I expect this to increase, mainly due to the possible EV developments or investments in self-driving capabilities alongside other manufacturing capabilities. You can see that the Capex [spending](https://postimg.cc/yDsRdpLy) has been decreasing in the past years with just over $8.8B in payments for business acquisitions and the other traditional Capex spending. Some people may use the cash generated by [investing](https://postimg.cc/Mn9nG6Mz) activities as Capex, but that is more unreliable. I also can see the Capex going back up, so I wanted to be safe and implied a 10% growth.

This money would account for over $73B in [expenses](https://postimg.cc/dZnY91K1) and would bring the profit for the company to almost $104B before interest and taxes.

Moving on, let<U+0092>s see what interest income and expenses the [company](https://postimg.cc/cgy0x2ms) has had in the past few years. We can see a decrease in interest expense in the past few years as the company has been paying off debt, but they have also been generating less money in this department, with an overall decrease in this department of more than 50% in the past year, way less than the amount from 2018. So, for safety reasons, I used a 10% decline in both income and expenses [related](https://postimg.cc/QKgtZhZG) to interest, while increasing the other losses by 10%/year.

This would bring the company pre-tax income to just over $104B in 2025.

Let<U+0092>s move on to taxes. I know the Federal income tax rate is 21% for the [company](https://postimg.cc/ykY39pq1), but the actual effective tax rate for the company was lower than 15% in the past year, mainly due to lower tax-rates on foreign earnings alongside tax-benefits and tax-settlements. The average effective tax rate has been just over 16% in the past 3 years, but with more and more of the revenues coming from outside the US, I think it<U+0092>s safe to say that the company will have around a 15% effective tax rate by 2025, this obviously if nothing major changes in tax policy around the world.

So, Apple would [have](https://postimg.cc/Wqc3ytKw) $88.6B in income after tax by 2025 and with the current outstanding shares standing at just under 17B, so I don<U+0092>t even account for the company probably continuing to do share buybacks, this would mean a $5.22 [future](https://postimg.cc/4YytCLwL) earnings/share. And with today<U+0092>s price for Apple just around 136$, that would mean to [company](https://postimg.cc/RNf1qH44) is trading at just over 26 times forward price to earnings.

I don<U+0092>t think Apple will ever trade at a discount again, with the current PE [standing](https://postimg.cc/RqwqHQ6s) at over 40, I believe this will eventually go down, probably to around 35, despite the increase in services revenue, which is highly valued by investors. I think we can see Apple trade somewhere near 35 [times](https://postimg.cc/5H98PKv2) P/E in 2025, especially if something big happens with the EV project, this could be even higher, just look at Tesla which trades at [insane](https://postimg.cc/sBZhxMk5) P/E. Of course, we also have to take into consideration the dividends that will be received from owning the stock, as Apple has started to pay dividends almost a decade ago and has 9 years of dividend growth, with a 10% annual rate of [growth](https://postimg.cc/CnbZMbD2) in the past 5 years. [Here](https://postimg.cc/7CLT1G8C) is the dividend growth history for the company, as I also went conservative on this [estimate](https://postimg.cc/Tp7LcjGr) and implied a 7% growth for the next 2 years, 6% for 2023 and 2024 and just 5% in 2025.

So [here](https://postimg.cc/R3PK21QQ) are my 3 price targets for the company, [including](https://postimg.cc/JHR8JXvv) dividends but not reinvested. My bear case scenario is that Apple will trade at almost 165$ which implies a [return](https://postimg.cc/jCYzWhd2) of over 21% by 2025, while my base case scenario would see Apple trading at 195$ with a return of capital of 43%. I will also make the bull case for Apple trading at 225$ by 2025 with dividends included, which would imply just over 65% in gains by then.

I think this is possible as Apple has also [continued](https://postimg.cc/fJj36jMt) to buy back shares of the company on a constant basis, as they continue to an impressive campaign with over $72B worth of common stock repurchased in 2020. They continue to buy back shares at a very fast pace, having repurchased over 1.3M shares in 2019 and 2018, while also issuing less stock every year.

So here is the full [spreadsheet](https://postimg.cc/Z995KrzL) that I have projected for Apple by 2025 and the breakdown of everything i estimated \[ [1](https://postimg.cc/jCT7qdZJ) / [2](https://postimg.cc/DmcbSkMp) \] , if you do have another opinion or a suggestion please leave a comment down below, I think I have been conservative in most of my projections, but feel free to give your opinion.

Keep in mind, these targets might sound ridiculous, but just [look](https://postimg.cc/V50nHCSn) at the growth Apple has had in the last 5years. The company has increased in value by more 400% in just the past 5years and is over 100.000% up since it started trading. So yes, the valuation is mad right now for the company. So, are you willing to bet against Apple?

The company also has pristine [financials](https://postimg.cc/LYcYMxqf), with more than $65B in total assets compared to total liabilities, and more than $38B in cash and cash equivalents.

So, what do I expect in the next couple of days, weeks and months for Apple?

Let<U+0092>s look at this [CHART](https://postimg.cc/7592T1c8), so starting with the stock split, Apple saw a correction within the September stock market pullback, in a buy the news &amp; sell the event, after a huge runup post-announcement of the stock split. The stock entered a consolidation period, and didn<U+0092>t have any big catalysts, especially with new iPhone lineup not being included in the Q4 results due to the late launch. The stock found some levels of resistance near the $120 levels that it struggled to get past but acted also as support after breaking them just before the recent news of the possible EV developments or self-driving-features to be licensed to other car manufacturers. After that news the stock spiked and has now reached the previous highs made before the stock split and is facing some resistance, if the stock pushes over $140 I think we can officially say that it broke the resistance at those levels and is not just a fake-out. But I think it<U+0092>s likely that the stock will consolidate between 122 and 135$ in the next weeks until the next iPhone sales and quarterly results are released, as the stock has entered overbought territory again with an RSI over 70, the first time since the stock split.

So, what would I do? Well, I own Apple stock, and I really believe this company will remain the biggest or one of the biggest in the future, so I would really add on any weakness that the stock shows before the next quarter earnings are released, as typically Q1 [earnings](https://postimg.cc/V5t0FPTF) are the best for the company due to increased holiday sales combined with the launch of new products. I think any entry below 130$ would be really nice to start and build a position or increase it if you already own the stock. As I believe Apple is one of the most stable stocks out there with large institutional [holders](https://postimg.cc/3kqG3XcK) like Vanguard, BlackRock and Berkshire owning over 900M shares each.

Read until the end as I reveal my price target for Apple and also what I think will happen in the next couple of days, weeks &amp; months!**

**\~ Warning! Very Very Long Post\~**

Hello everyone! So, let<U+0092>s go over some of the latest news on Apple before moving on to some fundamental and technical analysis, predictions and my price target for the stock in the next years.

So, let<U+0092>s start with the [news](https://postimg.cc/Xrkwk6rP) that Apple will cut the App Store commission in half for small app developers starting in the next days, this will impact developers who earn less than $1M annually from the App Store Sales. This is likely to lead to a small decline in commission revenues for Apple as around 98% of the app developers will qualify for this tax reduction from 30% to 15%, but all these small developers only contribute to about 5% of the estimated $50B in annual revenues from the App Store, so that would be only a $1.25B loss for the company, that is less than half a % of the company<U+0092>s total net sales in the last fiscal year.

Also, these changes may lead to a potential long-term revenue boost, as it is likely this will lead to an increasing creation of apps which will generate more commissions in return.

Alongside this we also saw the company releasing the new MacBook<U+0092>s with their first in-house [chip](https://postimg.cc/vc39NF7x), which promises faster video and imaging processing [times](https://postimg.cc/CR5Fmj5V), with both [CPU](https://postimg.cc/Y4yLdrMd) and [GPU](https://postimg.cc/xJz8gLsd) performance up to 2 times faster than the latest PC laptop chip using just a fraction of the power consumption, with both of the macbooks promising big improvements in [battery](https://postimg.cc/1fp6y1rz) life. Apple is also [expected](https://postimg.cc/GHrtJ8vc) to roll out even more in-house chips in future products, as they have started the 2-year breakup with Intel chips.

We also saw Morgan Stanley [upgrading](https://postimg.cc/bZ5qMsSS) their base case to $191 at the end of November, as they have cited record lead times, supply chain forecasts and carriers demand as they expect that the company will sell around 270M iPhone in fiscal year 2021, that<U+0092>s 50M more than the consensus and almost 30M more than the previous estimate of Morgan Stanley, with an average selling price of 842$, 9% more than the base case, as people tend to chose the more expensive and high tech versions of the lineup in this new 5G cycle.

The 5G super-cycle, which I believe is on the way, and will continue in the next years, as 5G become more available worldwide, could still be the biggest thing coming right away for the company with 5G smartphones [expected](https://postimg.cc/LJptP88f) to surpass 4G sales by 2024, with the average sale price of the 5G phones also coming down, helping them become more popular.

They also [released](https://postimg.cc/PpWhPy31) an update iPad Pro and an all-new iPad Air in September which will also boost sales in this work-from-home environment that will keep the demand very high for this kind of products, just like the Macs. Alongside the increasing demand from the Wearables, Home &amp; Accessories that include Air Pods, Apple TV, Apple Watch, and many more products.

But the biggest reasons I believe Apple is poised for continued growth, is primarily due to its services business, as they start to have more and more services like the Apple ONE [BUNDLE](https://postimg.cc/4777MD3s), which include up to 6 services from (Apple Music, Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, Apple News+, the new Apple Fitness+ and the iCloud service) for a pretty reasonable price in my opinion [starting](https://postimg.cc/BLkDnqzj) from 15$ up to 30$/month, this could be a great option for families and even individuals who use their services a lot.

The latest services, [Fitness+](https://postimg.cc/cKV4KrsG) just launched in the past days, and is a direct competitor to the likes of Peloton, as the service is available on the iPhone, iPad or even Apple TV. This also makes consumers buy the Apple Watch which syncs to the other devices to show you all kinds of information. The Fitness+ app just on its own is 8$/month or 80$/year which is less expensive than Peloton subscription which charges 13$ or even traditional gyms like Planet Fitness at 10$/month.

I think this will be the fastest growing sector for the company, as this aligns with the new macro trends, as the world is moving more and more to a digital approach to almost everything as consumer preferences, with more &amp; more younger people reaching the point in life when they use these services start to align to this increasing digital approach.

We also shouldn<U+0092>t forget the Apple Card &amp; Apple Pay service among many others which also seem to gain from the move to digital &amp; contactless payments, as this has been accelerated due to the current situation in the past year.

And one last piece of [news](https://postimg.cc/k6BKCVTr), and the most recent one, is that Apple may have fast-tracked the Titan project. The Titan project is targeting a 2024 or 2025 push to develop an electric vehicle with advanced battery technologies, that will deliver significant increases in range at much lower costs than the current technologies while also having self-driving capabilities.

It<U+0092>s reported they will not use the same technology as Tesla Full-Self-Driving feature, but will use LIDAR sensors, similar to those that we can find in the latest iPhone 12 PRO.

I think Apple can go 2 ways with this project, they can either use the huge amount of cash the company has to buy another car-maker like Ford, GM or any other car manufacturer expect Tesla and Toyota which do have a big market cap, so that they can fast-track the potential manufacturing of cars, or they can enter into a partnership with big companies like Tesla, Volkswagen or any other car marker to either produce cars or license their technology to this other car-makers which would ultimately and probably have higher margin-returns than the actual manufacturing of cars. Apple<U+0092>s current overall [gross margins](https://postimg.cc/ykv1mfVP) stand at 38% vs the 15% average of the world top 10 automakers by market cap, which is significantly lower.

But this Apple Car thing is so long out, and there are so many unknowns, I will not try to predict anything related to this until there is more clarity on the subject.

And last, before moving on to some predictions, here are some of the highlights that we heard from the latest investors conference meeting, as the CEO, Tim Cook [expressed](https://postimg.cc/TyhpLzgg) optimism ahead with the launch of many new products and services, especially the Home Pod Mini and the new 5G iPhones, as these new iPhones include new LIDAR scanners that greatly improve the camera capabilities, as the iPhone as seen very positive reviews. We also saw the Senior VP and CFO, Luca Maestri give us great [outlook](https://postimg.cc/DWDmqxPD) for the company as they expect the installed devices base to continue to growth despite already being at an all-time high as they have over 585M paid subscriptions on their platforms and expect this to surpass 600M by the end of 2020.

I also researched and found what products we can see in the near future, with the first half of [2021](https://postimg.cc/jCBQsXVM) bringing new iMacs, the AirPods3 and the iPad Pro, while in the [FALL](https://postimg.cc/8jVJKngg) event we will probably get the new iPhone 13 alongside the iPhone SE PLUS and the Watch Series 7 with more products coming [later](https://postimg.cc/GHc3s01t) in 2021 or that don<U+0092>t have an estimated release date like the Air Pods Pro, the Air Tags and the iPad Mini 6.

So, before even starting, you should now that I am bull on Apple but I am willing to hear other opinions so don<U+0092>t be afraid to leave a comment down below.

I have made some predictions based on the growth rate of the [company](https://postimg.cc/JHRDpPGQ), the latest plans announced by them and used some estimates. So, keep in mind this are only projections and are calculated by myself, this is not an investment advice and you should do your own research.

This are my 2025 projections for Apple, let<U+0092>s take a closer look at them, each on their own.

So, in term of revenues, Apple has 5 big sources of revenue, which saw an overall increase of 6% despite lagging sales in the iPhone. The biggest revenue is by a big margin the iPhone right now with over $137B in revenue in the fiscal year ending in September. I expect to see the iPhone sales increasing in the next years, especially in 2021, with the new 5G iPhone creating a super-cycle for the [company](https://postimg.cc/XGfBKT7J), as most iPhone users, including myself here, as I will upgrade from my iPhone X, will switch to this new product. The iPhone sales have decreased in the last couple of years by 14% and 3% as a result of the product not having big improvements, as well as iPhone usually starting to last longer than previous models, so I expect to see a 12% increase in sales next year and a gradual decrease in the growth of sales as more people upgrade, ending with just a 5% growth in iPhone [sales](https://postimg.cc/V0wfRpr7) in 2025.

The next revenues stream is from the Mac, which has seen an increase in the past 2years, with revenues topping $28B this year after the huge demand from the work from home consumers. I [expect](https://postimg.cc/1405tm2b) this trend to continue as they plan to continue to launch better products and I can see the company having a similar growth next year before starting to decline slightly until 2025, also ending with a 5% growth.

The iPad is currently the smallest revenue stream for Apple but has also seen an increase in demand in the past 2 years with a 13% average increase in revenues. I also expect the iPad to continue to grow in the next couple of years, especially with the learn-from-home environment for kids, and even after this period ends, the transformation for learning will implicate more digital usage. I [expect](https://postimg.cc/5XKtVsT0) the iPad to see some similar growth to the Macs, especially with the latest generation also bringing a new iPad air to the market.

The 4th revenue stream and the fastest growing in the past 2 years, with an average growth of 33% are the wearables, home &amp; accessories revenues. This have topped $30B this year, as Apple has also just launched the Apple Watch series 6 and also feature other great products like Apple TV, the Air Pods the Home Pod and the Home Pod mini alongside other third-party accessories.

I gave this [revenue](https://postimg.cc/v4C4JQ4T) stream a growth of 20% starting next year with a gradual decrease to around 8% by 2025, as I believe this will become more &amp; more popular as they start to have more vertical integration.

And last, but by no means least, the revenue stream that I expect to grow the most and the fastest is the revenue from the services that Apple gets. This includes revenues from Apple Care, Advertising, Cloud Services, Payment Services like Apple Card &amp; Apple Pay and of course the digital content which includes fees from the App Store alongside subscription-based revenue including the new Apple One Bundle and Apple Fitness+ alongside the already know Apple Arcade, Apple Music, Apple News+, Apple TV+ and hopefully I don<U+0092>t forget any others.

So, I [expect](https://postimg.cc/svV7mDWR) this to become the clear 2nd biggest revenue stream for Apple by 2025, as I expect this to grow more than 20% next year, mainly due to the Apple One Bundle and Apple Fitness+ followed up by a slightly decreasing growth, ending with a 10% increase in revenues in 2025.

I think this are fairly conservative base case scenarios for the revenues, as I expect them to continue to increase the [other](https://postimg.cc/1VFFgkxJ) revenue streams and not have such a large percentage of the revenues coming from the iPhone sales as you can see in this chart.

In terms of expenses, I pretty much kept the same margins as in previous years, with a 68% expense ratio on product sales \[ [iPhone](https://postimg.cc/JDZ7jMnD) / [iPad](https://postimg.cc/Wd14CB9C) / [Mac](https://postimg.cc/q6GkZw2p) / [WHA](https://postimg.cc/211q9q8g) \] and 35% expense ratio on [SERVICES](https://postimg.cc/8sdLLrjH), as this are way more lucrative.

In the past 3 years, the products [gross margin](https://postimg.cc/ykv1mfVP) was 32.7%, so I actually imply bigger expenses for the manufacturing and sales of products, as this is mostly impacted by the company<U+0092>s supplier<U+0092>s ability to make up for and demand, while for the services revenue, the gross margins for the last 3 years has been 63.5% on average, but I expect this to be more in-line with the 66% margin in this past year. So, if services manage to grow to about half the revenues from the iPhone, this will double the gross revenues, as every buck gained in the service revenues account for 2$ in the product sales.

So, I expect the total [revenues](https://postimg.cc/sMjByQ2n) for Apple to increase from $274B in 2020 to over $440B by 2025, increasing by approximately 10%/year, while I will keep the expense ratio pretty much in-line and have them increasing by 11%/year, this would bring the total gross for Apple to $177B, increasing mainly due to the services revenues as I said earlier. This growth is just above the 4year [average](https://postimg.cc/Tp8g83mS), and below the 2018 levels, which we might see again with this 5G super-cycle and explosive growth in the services revenue.

I also think the company will continue to invest in both Capital Expenditure and Operating expenses.

I think the operating expenses will remain pretty much in line with the [previous](https://postimg.cc/2qBCfrnc) years, as this number has increased by 1% [annually](https://postimg.cc/Fd5JL9v8) both in R&amp;D and SG&amp;A. So, I will keep the exact percentages from previous years, as I expect the revenue to increase, thus I don<U+0092>t see a big increase percentage wise. This would account for over $60B in operating expenses by 2025 and over $11B in Capital Expenditures by 2025, as I expect this to increase, mainly due to the possible EV developments or investments in self-driving capabilities alongside other manufacturing capabilities. You can see that the Capex [spending](https://postimg.cc/yDsRdpLy) has been decreasing in the past years with just over $8.8B in payments for business acquisitions and the other traditional Capex spending. Some people may use the cash generated by [investing](https://postimg.cc/Mn9nG6Mz) activities as Capex, but that is more unreliable. I also can see the Capex going back up, so I wanted to be safe and implied a 10% growth.

This money would account for over $73B in [expenses](https://postimg.cc/dZnY91K1) and would bring the profit for the company to almost $104B before interest and taxes.

Moving on, let<U+0092>s see what interest revenue and expenses the [company](https://postimg.cc/cgy0x2ms) has had in the past few years. We can see a decrease in interest expense in the past few years as the company has been paying debt, but they have also been generating less money in this department, with an overall decrease in this department of more than 50% in the past year, way less than the amount from 2018. So, for safety reasons, I used a 10% decline in both revenues and expenses [related](https://postimg.cc/QKgtZhZG) to interest, while increasing the other losses by 10%/year.

This would bring the company pre-tax $$$ to just over $104B in 2025.

Let<U+0092>s move on to taxes. I know the Federal tax rate is 21% for the [company](https://postimg.cc/ykY39pq1), but the actual tax rate for the company was lower than 15% in the past year, mainly due to lower tax-rates on foreign earnings alongside tax-benefits and tax-settlements. The average tax rate has been just over 16% in the past 3 years, but with more and more of the revenues coming from outside the US, I think it<U+0092>s safe to say that the company will have around a 15% tax rate by 2025, this obviously if nothing major changes in tax policy around the world.

So, Apple would [have](https://postimg.cc/Wqc3ytKw) $88.6B in $$ after tax by 2025 and with the current outstanding shares standing at just under 17B, so I don<U+0092>t even account for the company probably continuing to do share buybacks, this would mean a $5.22 [future](https://postimg.cc/4YytCLwL) earnings/share. And with today<U+0092>s price for Apple just around 136$, that would mean to [company](https://postimg.cc/RNf1qH44) is trading at just over 26 times forward price to earnings.

I don<U+0092>t think Apple will ever trade at a discount again, with the current PE [standing](https://postimg.cc/RqwqHQ6s) at over 40, I believe this will eventually go down, probably to around 35, despite the increase in services revenue, which is highly valued by investors. I think we can see Apple trade somewhere near 35 [times](https://postimg.cc/5H98PKv2) P/E in 2025, especially if something big happens with the EV project, this could be even higher, just look at Tesla which trades at [insane](https://postimg.cc/sBZhxMk5) P/E. Of course, we also have to take into consideration the dividends that will be received from owning the stock, as Apple has started to pay dividends almost a decade ago and has 9 years of dividend growth, with a 10% annual rate of [growth](https://postimg.cc/CnbZMbD2) in the past 5 years. [Here](https://postimg.cc/7CLT1G8C) is the dividend growth history for the company, as I also went conservative on this [estimate](https://postimg.cc/Tp7LcjGr) and implied a 7% growth for the next 2 years, 6% for 2023 and 2024 and just 5% in 2025.

So [here](https://postimg.cc/R3PK21QQ) are my 3 price targets for the company, [including](https://postimg.cc/JHR8JXvv) dividends but not reinvested. My bear case scenario is that Apple will trade at almost 165$ which implies a [return](https://postimg.cc/jCYzWhd2) of over 21% by 2025, while my base case scenario would see Apple trading at 195$ with a return of capital of 43%. I will also make the bull case for Apple trading at 225$ by 2025 with dividends included, which would imply just over 65% in gains by then.

I think this is possible as Apple has also [continued](https://postimg.cc/fJj36jMt) to buy back shares of the company on a constant basis, as they continue to an impressive campaign with over $72B worth of common stock repurchased in 2020. They continue to buy back shares at a very fast pace, having repurchased over 1.3M shares in 2019 and 2018, while also issuing less stock every year.

So here is the full [spreadsheet](https://postimg.cc/Z995KrzL) that I have projected for Apple by 2025 and the breakdown of everything i estimated \[ [1](https://postimg.cc/jCT7qdZJ) / [2](https://postimg.cc/DmcbSkMp) \] , if you do have another opinion or a suggestion please leave a comment down below, I think I have been conservative in most of my projections, but feel free to give your opinion.

Keep in mind, these targets might sound ridiculous, but just [look](https://postimg.cc/V50nHCSn) at the growth Apple has had in the last 5years. The company has increased in value by more 400% in just the past 5years and is over 100.000% up since it started trading. So yes, the valuation is mad right now for the company. So, are you willing to bet against Apple?

The company also has pristine [financials](https://postimg.cc/LYcYMxqf), with more than $65B in total assets compared to total liabilities, and more than $38B in cash and cash equivalents.

So, what do I expect in the next couple of days, weeks and months for Apple?

Let<U+0092>s look at this [CHART](https://postimg.cc/7592T1c8), so starting with the stock split, Apple saw a correction within the September stock market pullback, in a buy the news &amp; sell the event, after a huge runup post-announcement of the stock split. The stock entered a consolidation period, and didn<U+0092>t have any big catalysts, especially with new iPhone lineup not being included in the Q4 results due to the late launch. The stock found some levels of resistance near the $120 levels that it struggled to get past but acted also as support after breaking them just before the recent news of the possible EV developments or self-driving-features to be licensed to other car manufacturers. After that news the stock spiked and has now reached the previous highs made before the stock split and is facing some resistance, if the stock pushes over $140 I think we can say that it broke the resistance at those levels and is not just a fake-out. But I think it<U+0092>s likely that the stock will consolidate between 122 and 135$ in the next weeks until the next iPhone sales and quarterly results are released, as the stock has entered overbought territory again with an RSI over 70, the first time since the stock split.

So, what would I do? Well, I own Apple stock, and I would really add on any weakness that the stock shows before the next quarter earnings are released, as typically Q1 [earnings](https://postimg.cc/V5t0FPTF) are the best for the company due to increased holiday sales combined with the launch of new products. I think any entry below 130$ would be really nice to start and build a position or increase it if you already own the stock.

Hello everyone and Good Morning! So, let<U+0092>s start with the recap of yesterday, as we saw all 3 big indexes closing the day in the red despite hitting intraday records, with the [NASDAQ COMPOSITE](https://ibb.co/PCN8dwz) losing .38%, while both the broad market [SP500](https://ibb.co/cDjpNKP) and the [DOW JONES](https://ibb.co/RydQj61) Industrial finished the day down just over .2% as we also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/44wGzR0) rising by more than 4% yesterday as the $2000 stimulus was [BLOCKED](https://ibb.co/WFNSpCH) in the Senate by McConnell and the Georgia Senate runoff election is just a week away.

Almost 70% of the [COMPANIES](https://ibb.co/LYM4JfL) were declining yesterday on below average volume as the number of companies that were trading above the 50-day moving average fell under 70% for the first time in quite a while.

We saw 9 of the 11 [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/GRJSmht) closing in the red yesterday, with only the Health Care and Consumer Discretionary sectors having small gains as almost all the types of companies were losing ground [YESTERDAY](https://ibb.co/7tKPyP4), especially the small-caps with the small-cap growth group losing more than 2%.

Here is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/KjVsn9X) from yesterday, it<U+0092>s mostly red, with only a couple of companies that were gaining big like the Chinese companies alongside Amazon and Intel.HEAT

We also got some economic data yesterday, as a review of the 2020 aviation and air travel [ESTIMATED](https://ibb.co/hRbYxpG) that traffic will be down 67% since last year, dropping to levels not seen since 1999, as air travel is still struggling to come back after the march bottoms. This has affected most of the [COMPANIES](https://ibb.co/FBq4g37) worldwide but it seems that China airlines is doing somewhat better with the biggest percentage of the total number of flights completed compared to last year.

The SP Home price [INDICES](https://ibb.co/W67RBYh) also came in better than expected with the National Index increasing by 1.4% M/M, as this is a leading measure of real estate prices, gaining 8.4% nationwide over year ago. 

These moves can also be seen in the latest Redfin report, as home sales [PRICES](https://ibb.co/CwR5H56) are up 14% year/year to over $320K with a great increase in pending [SALES](https://ibb.co/mJtrwV9) which are also up more than 34% since last year, as the number of active [LISTINGS](https://ibb.co/vVkfMMh) of home sales is down more than 30%, as buyers can<U+0092>t snatch them up quick enough with such low [YIELDS](https://ibb.co/7j1kY3s), as this has led for the [AVERAGE](https://ibb.co/gzQq8Wb) sale price to list value to rise to 99.4% which Is up 1.5% since 2019. This should be good news for companies like Toll Brothers, Lennar, HD and LOW.

This was also accompanied by the great numbers in the us chain store sales [NUMBERS](https://ibb.co/4PykPcH), which rose by almost 9% y/y with December sales expected to rise almost 5% since last year and a .2% increase since last month.

While [TODAY](https://ibb.co/8N3YMPV) we start the day with MBA Mortgage applications, home sales and the Chicago PMI alongside advance reads on many other data points.

In some other stock market [NEWS](https://ibb.co/q1J6Snv), we saw Apple cool of a little yesterday, losing more than 1% for the day while they also lost a lawsuit aimed of stopping Corellium using virtual iPhone for security researching in the operating system, while [INTEL](https://ibb.co/3vvXFGT) finally got a breather and recovered some of the recent loses, after an activist hedge fund manager pushed for strategic changes in the company as Intel is losing market share and top designers, with the company also [ISSUING](https://ibb.co/WgtwTrY) a statement that lifted spirits around the stock.

We also saw the [FAA](https://ibb.co/6rJ6bHd) introduce new rules for drones, this may have a big impact on companies like UPS, Walmart and Amazon, as all of them have started trials for drone-delivery, as this could lead to better margins for the companies.

The Fed also [EXTENDED](https://ibb.co/cxV3HkC) the main street lending programs until Jan. 8 with the approval of Mnuchin as they try to process a bunch of applications this month, this means we can get even more money put into the economy and eventually the stock markets which is good news.

And meanwhile, AstraZeneca<U+0092>s vaccine was [APPROVED](https://ibb.co/y5QWbmh) for emergency use in the UK, this is another weapon to find this freaking illness, while JNJ will give us some results in early 2021 and Novavax just started their trial in the US.

Also, one last piece of data that I found recently shows that there was indeed a huge spike this [YEAR](https://ibb.co/JrKw01B) in the move to live streaming video and pre-recorded videos this year, as this has boosted companies like Peloton, Lululemon and others.

Hello everyone and Good Morning!

First of all, I wanted to wish everyone a happy new year and hopefully things get better in 2021, and this also brings us at least the great returns that we had in 2020 in the stock market! 

So, let<U+0092>s start with the recap of yesterday, as we saw all 3 big indexes finish the last full trading day of the year in the green, with the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/0cvjjHN) leading the way, up .24% and closing at a new record high, while both the tech heavy [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/QFyd2f6) and the broad market [SP500](https://ibb.co/B67fT1g) were up just over .1% for the day.

We also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/b6Nqf9Z) barely drop yesterday closing just below 23, and with the Georgia runoff election just days away, we can see this going higher if the Democrats win both seats.

We saw almost 70% of the companies advancing [yesterday](https://ibb.co/g9CHK9Q) with most of them trading way below average volume as 7 of the 11 [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/LzXDF2P) finished in the green, with Energy &amp; Materials closing the day up more than 1.3% while the biggest loser was the Communications sector, falling almost 0.7%, as we saw the small-cap stocks regain some momentum, [leading](https://ibb.co/yQCFtTZ) the way after they had 2 very bad days to start the week, while the only group that was losing ground yesterday was the large-cap growth sector.

Here is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/x5bN7Lk) from yesterday that pretty much sums up the other charts as we can see most big tech companies like Amazon, Google, Microsoft and even Apple losing ground for the day, while the biggest gainers were companies like Tesla &amp; TSM alongside the industrial sector and companies like Disney and Mastercard.

Yesterday we also got the investor sentiment [SURVEY](https://ibb.co/7QPXjPV), which for me personally came in pretty mixed, as I use this as a contrarian indicator. This last week we saw 2.5% more investors moving to the bull<U+0092>s camp, while we also saw almost a 5% increase in bears, as investors become more divided. I think the market is still a little to over bullish and I would avoid to add more money right now, but I wouldn<U+0092>t get of the stock market either. I think this is a good moment to stay put and wait for more developments overall, but there might still be some good opportunities around in the market and I wouldn<U+0092>t avoid getting into those.

We also got a lot of economic data yesterday, with a survey for business uncertainty for [December](https://ibb.co/87FMyQ6) showing increasing uncertainty for sales growth but a with a small decline in employment growth expectations. 

Meanwhile another number that confirms the investor sentiment survey is the Investor Confidence [Index](https://ibb.co/5952C9Z) which rose by more than 13 points in November, as investors increased the risk appetite for their portfolios.

Alongside this we also saw the November pending home [SALES](https://ibb.co/F8WBXnh) decrease by more than 2.5% month over month, but are still up more than 16% since a year ago, with this monthly decrease mostly coming due to the shortage of inventory.

The Chicago [PMI](https://ibb.co/QF40My3) also came in way better than expected and 59.5 vs 57 expected and up from the 58.2 in the previous month with the biggest movement coming from the employment indicator as it rose to a one year high but is still in contraction territory since 2019.

We also saw the wholesale [inventories](https://ibb.co/fkWmNmc) decrease in November<U+0092>s advance read while the [retail](https://ibb.co/BBKNrb5) inventories saw an increase of .7%, pretty much in-line with expectations while the trade [balance](https://ibb.co/CKSR070) also saw a surprise decline in the deficit to more than of $84B, $4B worse than the last revision.

[Today](https://ibb.co/D14JGZc) we get initial and continuing jobless claims numbers, alongside the money supply and the FED Balance sheet to end us off for the year as market close early today.

In some other stock market [news](https://ibb.co/GkZgGM1), we saw Fubo sink more than 14% again yesterday after another investing firm announced they have shorted the stock, pointing to the insane valuations of more than $13.000/subscriber.

We also saw a [research](https://ibb.co/QMF5fnG) that indicated some changes in the market share of car companies with Hyundai/Kia having the biggest gains alongside GM, while Nissan saw the biggest decline in market share, mostly due to selling larger &amp; pricier SUVs with cars continuing to see a decline in sales, while the larger vehicles have started to rebound slightly, as all car makers are [bringing](https://ibb.co/kJGkXtz) more &amp; more SUVs and Trucks to the market.

Lockheed Martin also was [awarded](https://ibb.co/bWS5G6j) a new Navy contract worth more than $900M as this might help the company start to get back on track while Mexico will become the world largest legal cannabis market as the Mexican Senate passed a bill in November which is [expected](https://ibb.co/VW3Lqtn) to receive approval in the lower house by February. This is great news for companies in the sector like ACB, Canopy Growth and the future merged company Tilray &amp; Aphria.

Also, one of the biggest active ETFs with over $15B in assets, the [ARK](https://ibb.co/80WJFdW) Innovation ETF saw it<U+0092>s first daily withdrawal since November, as this hasn<U+0092>t experienced weekly outflows since early in 2020, this might have been driven by profit taking as this ETF has surged more than 140% this year and also just the ex-dividend date on the 29th, as people expect for the ETF to have a hard time in duplicating the results of this year, which saw it rise on the back of Tesla and Roku with both of them seeing massive increases, with Tesla having more then 7x-ing this year, as that is the biggest holding in the ETF, but who knows we have to wait and see as [TESLA](https://ibb.co/ZzGQgqX) may hit 500K deliveries this year.

And one last piece of [news](https://ibb.co/9bQhB4B) is that Apple did a big purge in their App Store, removing almost 40K game apps as this was the deadline for the developers to submit a government issued license number that enabled users to make in-app purchases. I don<U+0092>t really think this will have a major impact for the revenues but we will soon find out.

Let<U+0092>s hope for a good day in the market as US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/mvv7tjX) seem to be pointing at a mixed open, with the Nasdaq and the SP500 pointing at a good open while the Dow is slightly down, and with no connection to this, in the UK, the [BREXIT](https://ibb.co/Rh1DYyG) chapter is finally about to close.

I think this is a good moment to stay put and wait for more developments overall, but there might still be some good opportunities around in the market and I wouldn<U+0092>t avoid getting into those.

We also got a lot of economic data yesterday, with a survey for business uncertainty for [December](https://ibb.co/87FMyQ6) showing increasing uncertainty for sales growth but a with a small decline in employment growth expectations. 

Meanwhile another number that confirms the investor sentiment survey is the Investor Confidence [Index](https://ibb.co/5952C9Z) which rose by more than 13 points in November, as investors increased the risk appetite for their portfolios.

Alongside this we also saw the November pending home [SALES](https://ibb.co/F8WBXnh) decrease by more than 2.5% month over month, but are still up more than 16% since a year ago, with this monthly decrease mostly coming due to the shortage of inventory.

The Chicago [PMI](https://ibb.co/QF40My3) also came in way better than expected and 59.5 vs 57 expected and up from the 58.2 in the previous month with the biggest movement coming from the employment indicator as it rose to a one year high but is still in contraction territory since 2019.

We also saw the wholesale [inventories](https://ibb.co/fkWmNmc) decrease in November<U+0092>s advance read while the [retail](https://ibb.co/BBKNrb5) inventories saw an increase of .7%, pretty much in-line with expectations while the trade [balance](https://ibb.co/CKSR070) also saw a surprise decline in the deficit to more than of $84B, $4B worse than the last revision.

[Today](https://ibb.co/D14JGZc) we get initial and continuing jobless claims numbers, alongside the money supply and the FED Balance sheet to end us off for the year as market close early today.

In some other stock market [news](https://ibb.co/GkZgGM1), we saw Fubo sink more than 14% again yesterday after another investing firm announced they have shorted the stock, pointing to the insane valuations of more than $13.000/subscriber.

We also saw a [research](https://ibb.co/QMF5fnG) that indicated some changes in the market share of car companies with Hyundai/Kia having the biggest gains alongside GM, while Nissan saw the biggest decline in market share, mostly due to selling larger &amp; pricier SUVs with cars continuing to see a decline in sales, while the larger vehicles have started to rebound slightly, as all car makers are [bringing](https://ibb.co/kJGkXtz) more &amp; more SUVs and Trucks to the market.

Lockheed Martin also was [awarded](https://ibb.co/bWS5G6j) a new Navy contract worth more than $900M as this might help the company start to get back on track while Mexico will become the world largest legal cannabis market as the Mexican Senate passed a bill in November which is [expected](https://ibb.co/VW3Lqtn) to receive approval in the lower house by February. This is great news for companies in the sector like ACB, Canopy Growth and the future merged company Tilray &amp; Aphria.

Also, one of the biggest active ETFs with over $15B in assets, the [ARK](https://ibb.co/80WJFdW) Innovation ETF saw it<U+0092>s first daily withdrawal since November, as this hasn<U+0092>t experienced weekly outflows since early in 2020, this might have been driven by profit taking as this ETF has surged more than 140% this year and also just the ex-dividend date on the 29th, as people expect for the ETF to have a hard time in duplicating the results of this year, which saw it rise on the back of Tesla and Roku with both of them seeing massive increases, with Tesla having more then 7x-ing this year, as that is the biggest holding in the ETF, but who knows we have to wait and see as [TESLA](https://ibb.co/ZzGQgqX) may hit 500K deliveries this year.

And one last piece of [news](https://ibb.co/9bQhB4B) is that Apple did a big purge in their App Store, removing almost 40K game apps as this was the deadline for the developers to submit a government issued license number that enabled users to make in-app purchases. I don<U+0092>t really think this will have a major impact for the revenues but we will soon find out.

Let<U+0092>s hope for a good day in the market as US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/mvv7tjX) seem to be pointing at a mixed open, with the Nasdaq and the SP500 pointing at a good open while the Dow is slightly down, and with no connection to this, in the UK, the [BREXIT](https://ibb.co/Rh1DYyG) chapter is finally about to close.

Now for bias and my own opinions:

I<U+0092>ve been following Apple most of my life. I worked on some of the first hackintosh distros (iatkos) as a broke college student. I can tell you definitively that a massive majority of Apple users are in the digital media and production space. With their prioritization on services the last few years, they<U+0092>ve really slacked in staying competitive in hardware. They<U+0092>ve also made some weird plays at being different without actually innovating. That<U+0092>s changed entirely this year. Their next earnings is going to reflect that. The M1 is a game changer. Almost everyone I know (which is hundreds of people in the digital agency space) have already or are planning on grabbing up Mac mini<U+0092>s or Airs because of the chip and price point. Apple is pretty much recession proof at this point. 

My predictions:

- 10% price increase leading up to Q1 earnings just off anticipation.
- 20% price increase post Q1 (probably within a week or two) and pre Q2
- An easy 100% increase by year end.

Summarized for you autists:

 - Gayle King went to an Apple store to conduct her (remote) interview with Tim Cook. She could have done the interview from anywhere.
 - Suggests whatever it is, it's at the apple store (not a product)
 - A morning show interview implies Apple's announcement will come out pretty early in the day (if not later today).
 - Also implies Apple thinks its non-product news will have impact / relevancy with the mass market.
 - Also, Gayle King is a big hitter for CBS. Doubtful this will be a ""we now offer Apple Card Monthly Installments for Apple Watch bands"" type of thing.
 - An ""Apple Stores as vaccination sites"" announcement makes sense to me.
 - Other people think it could be related to privacy (/u/XtremePhotoDesign: ""CES is taking place this week. Apple has used CES week to tout iOS privacy in the past. This is certainly an announcement related to iOS 14 privacy controls."")

From the Reddit post comments (/u/jturp-sc):

 - They're going to use Apple stores for vaccine distribution.
 - They're announcing some industry partnership (e.g. automotive joint venture) that will lead to future product(s). (my note: why would they have to do this at the store? Still my favorite idea)
 - The search engine is launching and somehow they don't consider it a ""product"" because it's free to use.
 - Donating an eye-watering amount of hardware to educational institutions to help with virtual school.

Now, in true autist fashion I haven't been following this stock for shit. Personally I'd just throw everything into AAPL or GOEV weeklikes, or, for the weak people, GOEVW","AAPL FD's in season?

Hello everyone and Good Morning! So, let<U+0092>s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw the stock market posting small gains, with the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/V2Yn5xJ) leading the way, up .28%, the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/hMpFmmF) gaining 60 points and the [SP500](https://ibb.co/YLYfs4V) finishing flat for the day, just about 3800, while the [VIX](https://ibb.co/sgR88nB) posted a 3% decline, though it seemed it was going to go back into higher volatility territory in the middle of the day

We also saw almost 70% of [companies](https://ibb.co/vHBQThL) advancing with 260 new highs on about average volume as 6 of the 11 [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/7pwD88M) finished in the green, with Energy leading the way yet again &amp; continuing to outperform in 2021, while Health Care and Communications lost more than 1%, with Large-Cap Growth Companies being the biggest laggard, also continuing the huge underperformance compared to all other factors, as small &amp; mid-caps have largely [outperformed](https://ibb.co/QH694Vc) since the start of the year.

Here is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/2Kt4ChR) from yesterday, with most big tech companies losing ground, though Tesla did recover after an 8% plunge on Monday and was also joined by the Banks, the Semiconductors and the Oil &amp; Gas companies.

Yesterday we also got some economic data, with the Small Business Optimism [INDEX](https://ibb.co/12TgvbS) falling sharply to 95.9 in December, vs the 102 expected and 101.4 in the previous month, as the small business optimism has continued to drop after the highs it made in September, while job [OPENINGS](https://ibb.co/S0VG5PZ) came pretty much in line with the previous report at 6.52M, as the openings rate remained double the quits rate. And in some better news we saw the worldwide semiconductor [MARKET](https://ibb.co/8NZ79p7) gaining 7% year over year to reach $39.4B for November, as the world will keep on needing more &amp; more semiconductors with improving technology, I really like this sector and I believe it<U+0092>s one of the best for long-term investing.

[Today](https://ibb.co/s3c5sMQ) we start the day off with the MBA Mortgage Applications, Consumer Price Index and finish the day with the Treasury Budget and the FED<U+0092>s Beige Book.

While in the IPO world, we will see [AFFIRM](https://ibb.co/6WqTmZX) start trading today, as the company set the final IPO price at $49 way above the first and second ranges between 33-44$. I really am interested in this company thought it<U+0092>s unlikely we will see shares available to retail traders under 60-70$ in my opinion, while in the M&amp;A department, we saw [VISA](https://ibb.co/CVkG87d) terminate the merger agreement with Plaid a year after the first announcement of the proposed transaction.

In some other stock market [NEWS](https://ibb.co/VBYhdY1), we saw Boeing land a $1.7B Air Force contract. This is good news for Boeing, as the commercial airlines business will be struggling at least for a couple of years until they ramp up the MAX production &amp; airline traffic demand goes back close to the levels seen before 2020, which might happen with more easily scalable vaccines coming soon from the likes of [JNJ](https://ibb.co/VCpS3Kw), while they also did suffer another hit with a plane crash in Asia, though it<U+0092>s not expected to be from a manufacturing defect, but [RATHER](https://ibb.co/Y2TZtNK) by the lax maintenance in the 9months the airplane was grounded last year.

We also saw Plug Power [skyrocket](https://ibb.co/3yChM7R) yet again, finishing the day up over 20% after the announcement of a hydrogen venture with Renault. This joint venture is [expected](https://ibb.co/LhFHnrX) to lead to further developments in fuel cell &amp; hydrogen fuel cell vehicle, that will be based on Renaults platforms, as the companies will combine the manufacturing capabilities of the OEM with the fuel cell &amp; hydrogen system knowledge from Plug Power. It<U+0092>s expected they will also provide refueling stations to help the ecosystem, in an effort to offer vertical integration with vehicles, fueling stations, services &amp; selling hydrogen fuel to customers. It<U+0092>s seems a good &amp; interesting development, but I would avoid buying it after such a huge [SPIKE](https://ibb.co/WkGwC79), it should have somewhat of a small pullback sometime soon.

In the Automobile world we also saw GM making a big splash at CES, with announcements of a big [PUSH](https://ibb.co/swv4wn3) into electric vans, a new Venture called BrightDrop that will develop even more electric-powered machinery and the surprise reveal of a [FLYING](https://ibb.co/G5bP3YX) Cadillac, while [TESLA](https://ibb.co/W2H1xrc) just registered its Indian entity just as ARK<U+0092>s Invest CEO [NOTED](https://ibb.co/qWjZqmF) that Tesla is still way ahead of Apple by taking a page from their own playbook when developing their own chips for the autonomous vehicles. I personally believe that there is enough room for both companies to exist in this new EV path by mostly crushing other traditional OEMs which aren<U+0092>t good enough at adopting this new trend like Nissan &amp; others.

We also saw Walmart adding even more news on the back of the [FINTECH](https://ibb.co/DVKSgGb) startup, as they are also planning on experimenting with even [MORE](https://ibb.co/g7qgstZ) delivery options, as the company seems to be trying to innovate as much as possible to increase the efficiency, as they try to compete as much as possible with online-purpose [RETAILERS](https://ibb.co/YjMjDLw) that are high flying yet again.

And one last piece of [NEWS](https://ibb.co/zQBd1L5), is that we saw a report that suggests the iPhone 12 sold 18M units in China in the last quarter of 2020, exceeding all expectations and more than doubling their market share from 10% to over 20%, thus delivering a hit to Asian manufacturers of smartphones. This is exactly what I expected as the new iPhone 12 lineup should be a hit around the world, with many loyal Apple brand followers switching to the 5G technology and to the better camera capabilities. This will also help Apple increase the services business revenue streams, as an increased devices base will lead to increased services usage.

So, let<U+0092>s hope for a good day in the markets as both the [WORLD](https://ibb.co/HB5P34r) Markets and the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/BgwpqT8) are mixed, with the Nasdaq posting to a small open gain.

As far as I can tell as long as you don<U+0092>t buy short term expiry calls it literally cannot go tits up. Although there is evidence to suggest Apple just had an outstanding quarter lets assume that they only see a share value increase of about 5% (a little below average) by Feb 5. With a 2/19 $130.00 c position you would still net about 30% in gains. With AAPL shares being down recently there<U+0092>s more room for growth.

Right now, podcasts are an adman<U+0092>s game: Spotify and other top companies in the space, like Amazon and SiriusXM, spent the past few years <U+0093>swallow[ing] up podcasting production firms in an effort to gain more control of the podcast ad market,<U+0094> per The Information. 

Think: Stitcher, The Ringer, etc. 

Come back later: It could be bad timing for Spotify, which recently saw shares decline after analysts at Citi downgraded its stock because Spotify hasn<U+0092>t shown <U+0093><U+0091>any material benefit<U+0092><U+0085>from its $800 million-plus investment in podcasting content and tech,<U+0094> per Variety. 

And, in theory, a major subscription service has the potential to yield more money for creators than the ads keeping them afloat now. 

Why it matters: This isn't the first ad-free subscription podcasting service, but Apple's deep pockets give it a better shot at disruption than smaller upstarts (looking at you, Luminary).

Hello everyone and Good Morning! So, let<U+0092>s start with the recap of Friday as we saw most of the stock market giving up some of the big gains of the week, with the broad stock market [SP500](https://ibb.co/ZxdGSkm) losing .30% &amp; the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/MRn5Q40) Industrial dropping 179 points while the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/F3wm2d8) barely managed to post a small gain for the day as we also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/JRkwsZn) ticking up a little but finishing under 22 for the week, with the Nasdaq gaining 4.2% in the short week the SP500 rising 1.9% and the Dow Jones posting a .6% gain.

About 55% of the [companies](https://ibb.co/hFF1hSm) were advancing on below average volume as the number of companies moving above the moving averages still remains very high. We only saw 3 of the 11 [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/pPJpQCk) posting small gains for the day while the biggest losers were the value play in Financials, Energy and Industrials, all losing more than .50%

For the week we saw communications outperform with a big spike after Netflix reported earnings, while Energy had more than one ugly day dropping big on Monday, Thursday and Friday.

Small-caps faired better to close out the [week](https://ibb.co/y0C39gJ), with all 3 groups posting gains of more than 1.5% while Large-Cap Value companies underperformed losing more than 2.5% for the week, as Growth Companies &amp; Especially the big-caps finally outperformed this week, gaining 2.3%.

Here is the HEAT MAP from [Friday](https://ibb.co/MnWSRV4), which was a pretty mixed bag, with Apple posting a big gain ahead of the earnings report while the other big tech companies also posted small-gains. For the [WEEK](https://ibb.co/BfYRHWS) though, we saw huge gains in most of the big tech names with all the FAANG names and Microsoft gaining more than 5% for the week, while Banks alongside Oil &amp; Gas companies were the biggest losers

We also got some economic data on Friday as existing home [sales](https://ibb.co/KWxRW9m) rose again while the inventory is still at all time-lows of under 2 months of supply while the January [PMI](https://ibb.co/x54dqCy) current read came in at 58, way above the 55.5 expected and 55.3 in the previous read as both the Services and Manufacturing PMI saw a spike of more than 2 points

This week we also start the [EARNINGS](https://ibb.co/2nsRvBx) frenzy, with AMD which might benefit from Intel<U+0092>s drop last week, Microsoft &amp; Starbucks reporting after Tuesday<U+0092>s close as JNJ might also give some updates regarding their vaccine, while big value companies like Boeing, AT&amp;T &amp; Caterpillar report before the open on Wednesday &amp; Friday. We also have some of the big tech names reporting on the same day, with Apple which is expected to have their first $100B quarter, Tesla &amp; Facebook reporting after Wednesday<U+0092>s close which might be a bigger volatility moment for the market depending on how the results come in.

In terms of economic [data](https://ibb.co/Fx6TWyw), we start off [today](https://ibb.co/4K4DDvp) with the Dallas FED Manufacturing survey but the most interesting ones are on Thursday &amp; Friday, while we also wait to see what the FED announces in terms keeping the rates low &amp; the money printer going with asset buying on Wednesday.

In some other stock market, we saw [Palantir](https://ibb.co/zV2vxft) soar on Friday, rising more than 25% to break the $30 levels after they updated their Demo Day scheduled for tomorrow. It<U+0092>s expected that they will reveal the latest developments in their big software platforms and also reveal [new](https://ibb.co/swYH61R) software platforms that will continue to help the company grow such as SDDI, Low-Code/No-Code and other modular strategy software.

We also saw [Ford](https://ibb.co/D8cmmZn) soaring again, as the company is having the best monthly performance in more than 10 years and spiked more than 6% after JP Morgan upgraded the company based on their new product line which is what I<U+0092>ve been saying about the company in some months now. Tesla is going to face serious competition in the next decade with all the other car manufactures pushing harder and harder into the EV world, with some of the most popular cars out there like the F150, the Bronco and other models joining the sector that will continue to improve and might actually become a good alternative to Tesla<U+0092>s models. It<U+0092>s the same with others like [GM](https://ibb.co/42G3ttK) which might be a good catch-up play compared to Tesla. By the way<U+0085> [GM](https://ibb.co/vPwbPCs) is outperforming Tesla recently based on their developments in the EV &amp; self-driving sector.

Meanwhile, [GME](https://ibb.co/bXYsj4k) had a wild day on Friday, gaining more than 50% despite being even higher as the battle between WSB &amp; the shorts continues, with this move making Citron<U+0092>s Left deciding to avoid further talks about the company probably in an attempt to avoid future attention at the GameStop short squeeze. Short Squeeze has seen a big rise in terms of [search](https://ibb.co/qn51BPH) interest after these latest moves in the GameStop stock and might even put more pressure on the bears, as retail investors might pump up this stock even more.

So, guys, this week might bring a lot of volatility depending on many of the important events we have. Earnings seasons &amp; especially big tech results will be important to justify these high multiples most of the tech names have received, while we also have to see how the GDP comes in, as it is expected to have seen a 4% growth for the 4th quarter while the FED is under pressure to keep the money printer on and the rates low, if not, or if there is any doubt in their commitments and also some numbers come in worse than expected we might see the long-awaited correction/pullback.

So, let<U+0092>s hope for a good day in the markets as the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/929L2rz) are pointing to a very good open, with the Nasdaq leading the way up almost 1%

The earnings frenzy starts with Apple, Tesla, Facebook &amp; Microsoft reporting. GameStop, GM &amp; Ford spiked last week, let<U+0092>s talk about this and other stock market news**

**\~Very Long Post\~**

Hello everyone and Good Morning! So, let<U+0092>s start with the recap of Friday as we saw most of the stock market giving up some of the big gains of the week, with the broad stock market [SP500](https://ibb.co/ZxdGSkm) losing .30% &amp; the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/MRn5Q40) Industrial dropping 179 points while the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/F3wm2d8) barely managed to post a small gain for the day as we also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/JRkwsZn) ticking up a little but finishing under 22 for the week, with the Nasdaq gaining 4.2% in the short week the SP500 rising 1.9% and the Dow Jones posting a .6% gain.

About 55% of the [companies](https://ibb.co/hFF1hSm) were advancing on below average volume as the number of companies moving above the moving averages still remains very high. We only saw 3 of the 11 [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/pPJpQCk) posting small gains for the day while the biggest losers were the value play in Financials, Energy and Industrials, all losing more than .50%

For the week we saw communications outperform with a big spike after Netflix reported earnings, while Energy had more than one ugly day dropping big on Monday, Thursday and Friday.

Small-caps faired better to close out the [week](https://ibb.co/y0C39gJ), with all 3 groups posting gains of more than 1.5% while Large-Cap Value companies underperformed losing more than 2.5% for the week, as Growth Companies &amp; Especially the big-caps finally outperformed this week, gaining 2.3%.

Here is the HEAT MAP from [Friday](https://ibb.co/MnWSRV4), which was a pretty mixed bag, with Apple posting a big gain ahead of the earnings report while the other big tech companies also posted small-gains. For the [WEEK](https://ibb.co/BfYRHWS) though, we saw huge gains in most of the big tech names with all the FAANG names and Microsoft gaining more than 5% for the week, while Banks alongside Oil &amp; Gas companies were the biggest losers

We also got some economic data on Friday as existing home [sales](https://ibb.co/KWxRW9m) rose again while the inventory is still at all time-lows of under 2 months of supply while the January [PMI](https://ibb.co/x54dqCy) current read came in at 58, way above the 55.5 expected and 55.3 in the previous read as both the Services and Manufacturing PMI saw a spike of more than 2 points

This week we also start the [EARNINGS](https://ibb.co/2nsRvBx) frenzy, with AMD which might benefit from Intel<U+0092>s drop last week, Microsoft &amp; Starbucks reporting after Tuesday<U+0092>s close as JNJ might also give some updates regarding their vaccine, while big value companies like Boeing, AT&amp;T &amp; Caterpillar report before the open on Wednesday &amp; Friday. We also have some of the big tech names reporting on the same day, with Apple which is expected to have their first $100B quarter, Tesla &amp; Facebook reporting after Wednesday<U+0092>s close which might be a bigger volatility moment for the market depending on how the results come in.

In terms of economic [data](https://ibb.co/Fx6TWyw), we start off [today](https://ibb.co/4K4DDvp) with the Dallas FED Manufacturing survey but the most interesting ones are on Thursday &amp; Friday, while we also wait to see what the FED announces in terms keeping the rates low &amp; the money printer going with asset buying on Wednesday.

In some other stock market, we saw [Palantir](https://ibb.co/zV2vxft) soar on Friday, rising more than 25% to break the $30 levels after they updated their Demo Day scheduled for tomorrow. It<U+0092>s expected that they will reveal the latest developments in their big software platforms and also reveal [new](https://ibb.co/swYH61R) software platforms that will continue to help the company grow such as SDDI, Low-Code/No-Code and other modular strategy software.

We also saw [Ford](https://ibb.co/D8cmmZn) soaring again, as the company is having the best monthly performance in more than 10 years and spiked more than 6% after JP Morgan upgraded the company based on their new product line which is what I<U+0092>ve been saying about the company in some months now. Tesla is going to face serious competition in the next decade with all the other car manufactures pushing harder and harder into the EV world, with some of the most popular cars out there like the F150, the Bronco and other models joining the sector that will continue to improve and might actually become a good alternative to Tesla<U+0092>s models. It<U+0092>s the same with others like [GM](https://ibb.co/42G3ttK) which might be a good catch-up play compared to Tesla. By the way<U+0085> [GM](https://ibb.co/vPwbPCs) is outperforming Tesla recently based on their developments in the EV &amp; self-driving sector.

Meanwhile, [GME](https://ibb.co/bXYsj4k) had a wild day on Friday, gaining more than 50% despite being even higher as the battle between WSB &amp; the shorts continues, with this move making Citron<U+0092>s Left deciding to avoid further talks about the company probably in an attempt to avoid future attention at the GameStop short squeeze. Short Squeeze has seen a big rise in terms of [search](https://ibb.co/qn51BPH) interest after these latest moves in the GameStop stock and might even put more pressure on the bears, as retail investors might pump up this stock even more.

So, guys, this week might bring a lot of volatility depending on many of the important events we have. Earnings seasons &amp; especially big tech results will be important to justify these high multiples most of the tech names have received, while we also have to see how the GDP comes in, as it is expected to have seen a 4% growth for the 4th quarter while the FED is under pressure to keep the money printer on and the rates low, if not, or if there is any doubt in their commitments and also some numbers come in worse than expected we might see the long-awaited correction/pullback. But I don<U+0092>t think numbers or the FED are going to disappoint really, but that doesn<U+0092>t exclude the possibility of the pullback<U+0085> keep investing safely &amp; have some money available to buy the dips if they appear, use them as a buying opportunity, not a panic sell.

So, let<U+0092>s hope for a good day in the markets as the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/929L2rz) are pointing to a very good open, with the Nasdaq leading the way up almost 1%

***Raymond James analyst Chris Caso*** repeated his Outperform rating, lifting his price target to $150 from $140. *""For December, we believe iPhone units were simply in-line with expectations, but the story is about mix, as consumers appear to have preferred the higher-priced models in the lineup, perhaps encouraged by generous U.S. carrier subsidies,*"" he writes. ""*We also expect healthy upside from AirPods, Watch, and Macs, for which we've seen consistent positive supply-chain revisions."" He adds that while the stock has had a big run, ""we see no reason to change our favorable view, as we have long expected the 5G iPhone to represent a  two-year cycle.*"" 

***Wedbush analyst Dan Ives*** reiterates his Outperform rating, while lifting his target price to $175 from $160. ""Based on our Asia supply chain checks, we strongly believe the iPhone 12 supercycle hype has become a       reality with this week giving the Street its first glimpse of underlying iPhone 12 demand and key commentary from \[CEO Tim\] Cook looking ahead into the next few quarters,"" he writes in a research report. ""With more       order activity kicking in over the last few months for iPhone 12 our       reads are very bullish for the March/June quarters and give us       incremental confidence in our supercycle thesis on iPhone 12.""     

**Evercore ISI analyst Amit Daryanani** reiterated an Outperform rating, raising his price target to $160 from $145. The analyst writes that near term, he has a ""bullish bias,"" driven by an iPhone supercycle, better monetization of the installed base, and gross-margin expansion. Longer term, he is upbeat about a potential move into the automotive market.  ""*Discussions around Apple Car have become louder given recent commentary in the media and comments by \[manufacturers\] like Hyundai,*"" he writes. ""*We see increased probability that Apple will have a product here in the next five years.*""     

***J.P. Morgan analyst Samik Chatterjee***, who repeats an Overweight rating and $150 price target, expects the company to deliver a ""*blockbuster beat,*"" driven by 5G iPhones, iPads, and Macs. He's looking for revenue of $110 billion and profits of $1.56 a share, with iPhone revenue of $66 billion.     

Even NASDAQ articles points to upcoming block-buster beats [""Apple Stock Could Surge 62% to $225, According to This Analyst""](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/apple-stock-could-surge-62-to-%24225-according-to-this-analyst-2021-01-25).

Now some may say AAPL usually go down after earnings, I would argue that this quarter could be different as quantum of beat would be [huge like NFLX](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/20/netflix-stock-soars-13percent-on-subscriber-growth-and-possible-buybacks.html). Anyway UOA or Options buying should also indicate the upcoming move as the market makers do buy in large quantity. You can see for yourself that it is coming, [here at Options Sonar](https://www.optionsonar.com/unusual-option-activity/aapl/all-expirations).

In **early March/late February** I finish up the pitch book for my venture and feel ready to reach out to possible investors! I<U+0092>m thrilled and have high hopes of finding someone willing to invest a couple hundred thousand in exchange for equity.

I continued to send emails and messages, but by November I was aware I<U+0092>d most likely need to at least fund the 20-year patent myself. So I did what many of us have done this past year and cracked open my Robinhood account, did some research and jumped into the world of options.

I was part of the PLTR gang at one point which pushed my earnings a little further. I only had a couple thousand to work with and if I had a gain of a couple hundred with a single trade I felt on top of the world. But I knew the small gains weren<U+0092>t enough.

Backstory: In January 2020 I began creating a business plan for a business venture. I don<U+0092>t want to be banned for self promoting so I won<U+0092>t go into details about the business idea, I<U+0092>ll only say it<U+0092>s related to the automotive community (cars are a passion of mine). In February I got in contact with a patent attorney and was given two options. Start with a provisional patent by paying $3k, wait up to a year, then pay an additional $5k for the 20-year patent; OR spend all $8k right then and the attorney would begin working on the provisional and 20-year patent right away. Well I didn<U+0092>t have $8k at the time so I opted to pay the $3k and my goal was to have an angel investor by the time the provisional patent expired in a year.

3405,3405,AAPL,l6w5mw,0toHeroInvesting,2,1,"**Stocks have their worst day in over 3 months as the short squeeze continues. Apple, Facebook &amp; Tesla report earnings in after hours. Is this the next stock market crash or is it a good buying opportunity? Let<U+0092>s talk about this and other stock market news**

Hello everyone and Good Morning! So, let<U+0092>s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw the stock market have a decently sized pullback having the worst day since late October with the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/P1xJx99) losing 2.6%, the [SP500](https://ibb.co/1YC8JNG) dropping almost the same while the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/wrbybPT) also shed over 600 points as we saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/xYSBQLr) spiking more than 60%, touching levels not seen since before the November elections.

We saw 80% of the companies declining [yesterday](https://ibb.co/7gK9zNR) on huge volumes, as we saw a big correction in companies moving above the 50-day moving average, finally seeing an even split on this metric.

All 11 [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/ph43Ry0) finished in the red, with Communications, Health Care and Consumer Discretionary losing more than 3% for the day as value plays, especially the small ones did a little better [yesterday](https://ibb.co/smbJqbS), while growth companies gave up huge gains from the past weeks.

The [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/wRjjwYH) from yesterday pretty much sums up the stock market movement, with only a few companies posting gains, while massive tech names like Facebook, Tesla, Google, Amazon &amp; Netflix shed more than 2% for the day.

Yesterday we also got the Investor Sentiment [Survey](https://ibb.co/FBLKB9L) which showed an even bigger move for investors to the bearish side, as the number of bears has finally passed the number of bulls after very long time. I think that this sentiment alongside the stock market pullback from yesterday can be a good buying opportunity in some names that were trading at very high levels. I think we can see this sentiment move even more to the bearish side as we get next week<U+0092>s reporting, with a lot of investors panic selling after the stock market has had a pretty rough week<U+0085> 

So, don<U+0092>t panic, look for the good companies that have seen a pullback and build your position at a discount, as the [FED](https://ibb.co/gT71WRG) clearly implied yesterday that the money printer will still keep on printing for the foreseeable future, with the FED will keeping the interest rates anchored near 0 and continuing to buy $120B in assets as long as it<U+0092>s needed for the unemployment levels to go significantly lower and inflation to stand at a 2% average for a sustained period of time. 

Meanwhile, in terms of economic data we saw the business uncertainty slipping in [January](https://ibb.co/bd5JNQ2) as both sales growth and employment growth saw a decline from the previous month, while durable goods [growth](https://ibb.co/BtCGhKK) also significantly slowed down in December, though it was the 8th straight month of growth.

In some other stock market news, we continued to see the short squeeze on a very large number of stocks, this might have pushed the markets into sell-off mode as the recent squeeze pushed fund &amp; money managers to cover some of their positions, thus, having to sell off other assets. [Ameritrade](https://ibb.co/r255MqB) also restricted trades of squeezed stocks, while multiple trading platforms suffered [outages](https://ibb.co/QPj0Vp2) amid the high volatility in the market.

Companies that are benefiting from this should at least take advantage just like [AMC](https://ibb.co/fStMQ79) and do equity offerings to raise capital that might help them in their struggling businesses.

I don<U+0092>t know how much longer the short squeeze can go right now, as most of the fund &amp; money managers have closed their position in these highly shorted stocks, while WSB also got banned from [Discord](https://ibb.co/KzPGCwh), though they cited other reasons for banning the subreddit, not the ongoing short squeeze, while the [SEC](https://ibb.co/R4myTTZ) and other big players are closely watching the situation.

We also had [Apple](https://ibb.co/XbGJyLm) delivering great beats on both the revenues and earnings/share as they hit $111B in revenues for the quarter, which is the first time they<U+0092>ve had a quarter over $100B. The iPhone revenues overdelivered with the new iPhone 12 Lineup crushing expectations, as I expected, with over $65B in revenues as the iPhone<U+0092>s delayed release, strong incentives to upgrade and the broader stay-at-home market helped the sales rise more than expected, with all but one of the other categories also beating expectations while Mac revenues came in just shy of the expected figure.

China sales also recovered from a 29% y/y decline last quarter to a strong 57% gains this quarter, as this helped Apple generate record operating cash flow of almost $39B while returning over $30B to shareholders as they are targeting a net cash neutral position over time, thus continuing to reward shareholders. 

This didn<U+0092>t help the [stock](https://ibb.co/2K6vd1D) though as it struggled in after hours and was down more than 3%, as the sell-off continued like in most of the stocks.

The other big tech name that reported was [Facebook](https://ibb.co/S5CRXDL) as they also beat expectations on eps, revenues, daily &amp; monthly active users.

The initial reaction in after-hours was also bad for Facebook as they continue to expect ad-targeting headwinds due to the Apple platform changes and evolving regulatory landscape. They did however announce a $25B buyback program on top of the $8.6B remaining in the current one, though this didn<U+0092>t help as investors were disappointed in the drop in [usage](https://ibb.co/HxYpjqf) in North America, as most of the growth came from the Asia-Pacific region, which is not as profitable as North America yet.

And meanwhile, [Tesla](https://ibb.co/X2FzfrK) also reported in after-hours, as they missed on EPS by $0.25 on a smaller than expected automotive margin of 24.1%, though revenues increased by more than 45% year/year.

This was the 6th straight quarter of profit for the company, and Tesla expects the volume of car sales to have a sustained 50% average annual growth over multiple years though they didn<U+0092>t offer a clear target for 2021 while they also expect the Tesla Semi deliveries to start later in the year.

The one big [change](https://ibb.co/X48YGfJ) we saw, was Musk saying the company is open to licensing its software and allowing other companies to use the Supercharger network while the Full-Self-Driving subscriptions will be available <U+0093>very soon<U+0094> the company reported. I like Tesla very much, but at these levels, it<U+0092>s very hard to over-deliver time &amp; time again. The likelihood of Tesla rising 30 to 50% in the near future is smaller than the one that Tesla sees somewhat of a correction after the huge run to end 2020 and start 2021, so, I wouldn<U+0092>t add to my positions right now. Right now, and probably for the next couple of months Tesla is a hold for me and nothing more.

So, let<U+0092>s hope for a better day in the markets as the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/Mhs9VVV) are still pointing to a red open, while we await to see the [latest](https://ibb.co/rpfdSP8) jobless claims numbers and to see the GDP from Q4, which is expected to come in at a 4.3% annualized growth. Maybe if we get some positive read on the economic numbers, we might see a shift in the markets.

3406,3406,AAPL,l6w7e1,0toHeroInvesting,8,1,"**Stocks have their worst day in over 3 months as the short squeeze continues. Apple, Facebook &amp; Tesla report earnings in after hours. Is this the next stock market crash or is it a good buying opportunity? Let<U+0092>s talk about this and other stock market news**

Hello everyone and Good Morning! So, let<U+0092>s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw the stock market have a decently sized pullback having the worst day since late October with the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/P1xJx99) losing 2.6%, the [SP500](https://ibb.co/1YC8JNG) dropping almost the same while the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/wrbybPT) also shed over 600 points as we saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/xYSBQLr) spiking more than 60%, touching levels not seen since before the November elections.

We saw 80% of the companies declining [yesterday](https://ibb.co/7gK9zNR) on huge volumes, as we saw a big correction in companies moving above the 50-day moving average, finally seeing an even split on this metric.

All 11 [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/ph43Ry0) finished in the red, with Communications, Health Care and Consumer Discretionary losing more than 3% for the day as value plays, especially the small ones did a little better [yesterday](https://ibb.co/smbJqbS), while growth companies gave up huge gains from the past weeks.

The [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/wRjjwYH) from yesterday pretty much sums up the stock market movement, with only a few companies posting gains, while massive tech names like Facebook, Tesla, Google, Amazon &amp; Netflix shed more than 2% for the day.

Yesterday we also got the Investor Sentiment [Survey](https://ibb.co/FBLKB9L) which showed an even bigger move for investors to the bearish side, as the number of bears has finally passed the number of bulls after very long time. I think that this sentiment alongside the stock market pullback from yesterday can be a good buying opportunity in some names that were trading at very high levels. I think we can see this sentiment move even more to the bearish side as we get next week<U+0092>s reporting, with a lot of investors panic selling after the stock market has had a pretty rough week<U+0085>

So, don<U+0092>t panic, look for the good companies that have seen a pullback and build your position at a discount, as the [FED](https://ibb.co/gT71WRG) clearly implied yesterday that the money printer will still keep on printing for the foreseeable future, with the FED will keeping the interest rates anchored near 0 and continuing to buy $120B in assets as long as it<U+0092>s needed for the unemployment levels to go significantly lower and inflation to stand at a 2% average for a sustained period of time.

Meanwhile, in terms of economic data we saw the business uncertainty slipping in [January](https://ibb.co/bd5JNQ2) as both sales growth and employment growth saw a decline from the previous month, while durable goods [growth](https://ibb.co/BtCGhKK) also significantly slowed down in December, though it was the 8th straight month of growth.

In some other stock market news, we continued to see the short squeeze on a very large number of stocks, this might have pushed the markets into sell-off mode as the recent squeeze pushed fund &amp; money managers to cover some of their positions, thus, having to sell off other assets. [Ameritrade](https://ibb.co/r255MqB) also restricted trades of squeezed stocks, while multiple trading platforms suffered [outages](https://ibb.co/QPj0Vp2) amid the high volatility in the market.

Companies that are benefiting from this should at least take advantage just like and do equity offerings to raise capital that might help them in their struggling businesses.

I don<U+0092>t know how much longer the short squeeze can go right now, as most of the fund &amp; money managers have closed their position in these highly shorted stocks, while WSB also got banned from [Discord](https://ibb.co/KzPGCwh), though they cited other reasons for banning the subreddit, not the ongoing short squeeze, while the [SEC](https://ibb.co/R4myTTZ) and other big players are closely watching the situation.

We also had [Apple](https://ibb.co/XbGJyLm) delivering great beats on both the revenues and earnings/share as they hit $111B in revenues for the quarter, which is the first time they<U+0092>ve had a quarter over $100B. The iPhone revenues overdelivered with the new iPhone 12 Lineup crushing expectations, as I expected, with over $65B in revenues as the iPhone<U+0092>s delayed release, strong incentives to upgrade and the broader stay-at-home market helped the sales rise more than expected, with all but one of the other categories also beating expectations while Mac revenues came in just shy of the expected figure.

3440,3440,AAPL,lb1x11,philipmasters18,74,16,"Sorry, this is a looonngg post and there are definitely parts you don't need to read like the intro and the NVAX. I just wanted to make sure it was detailed and explained everything as I'm sure this sub has been riddled with posts identical to this recently.

So to start this off I'll admit that I dived straight in with no prior knowledge of investing with GME, AMC and the most stupid, a little bit of Dogecoin. I'm still hoping AMC will recover at least a little when theatres re-open as I bought at $15 lol. I sold half my $400 GME off early (bought at $320) for about $10 profit or something tiny. I still have $200 and I'm still holding on. I'm aware that this might not be wise but luckily, the one non-stupid thing I did with this is that I used a certain percentage of my profits from beermoney ventures (surveys, market research and the like) as well as my matched betting which means, that whilst it was stupid and it is frustrating to lose both my own money and potential profit due to my own lack of research, I haven't risked anything I couldn't afford to lose.

I'm getting older and busier so I don't always have time to be answering long and boring surveys anymore so I wanted to take the percentage of these profits and invest in relatively long term stocks. I've been doing some research and have purchased a couple of books and I've been looking into a variety of different stocks to start my portfolio. It's worth mentioning that I only have roughly $400-$500 to invest.

These are the shares I'm thinking/have already invested in:

**NVAX:**

Currently, I have $50 that I got at $211.91 a share in NVAX. For those who don't know NVAX recently developed a Coronavirus vaccine that is 89% effective, whilst this is less than Pfizer and Moderna, Pfizer and Moderna are not backed up by clinical trials and most importantly, NVAX was 89% effective against both the original and the new mutated Coronavirus. I think this will do quite well.


**AAPL:**

This is where the stocks I have end. AAPL is currenly at $135 which seems quite low and despite COVID, it has done really well financially. There is also mentioning of the Apple Car, Apple VR a new computer and it's increase in iPhone users this/last year. It seems like an obvious purchase but this is definitely where my lack of knowledge comes in. There have been all this stuff, huge revenues, new products and it's debt deal, yet over the past few days it's kinda stayed between $130 - $140 so I'm a bit uncertain on this one.

**FUBO:**

This seems like it could do very well and there's loose speculation of it being worth $200 by the end of the year. That being said, the subscription revenue isn't particularly long-term, but then, they do have a new betting service. They report earnings on March 2. I was thinking of putting in a sell order at around at some price between $40-$50 but I'm very clearly not an expert so was hoping someone might have better insight. I'm thinking that personally, this is too risky for me either way but would be nice to hear some insight so I can learn what to look out for.

**SQ**:

There was a bit of a dip in Square. They seem to be fundamentally quite strong since they cater to non-cash payments and for obvious reasons right now that seems pretty good. I think more importantly though, I don't want to go on about it but obviously a certain couple apps are in trouble and since CashApp now offers investing for a very similar user base it might increase. Like Apple this one seems obvious but then it's currently at $227. A optimistic look from investopedia says it'll go back up to $300. I assume there's a bit of a risk with that so with the risk and the fact that the optimistic increase would be from \~$230 to $300 I feel that now I might be a bit late.

This is the end of a very long post and thanks for reading it. I understand that it's impossible to say you should go with this stock as it's 100% going to profit but I think some tips with these stocks that I mentioned and I guess just general advice for things to look for that I may have missed in my small analyses. I find that for some reason, I'm always reluctant to invest in the big'uns like Tesla, Apple, Facebook, Microsoft as in my head they're just expensive shares that don't change much which is obviously untrue and probably a mindset of an inexperienced investor. Also, I'm aware that even over the span of a few years <U+00A3>400 might not necessarily make me lots but I'm using this time to come to grips with it more so that when I have a bigger income I'm more experienced. Also, I feel it's worth adding that I am a computer science and electronics student and I imagine investing in things you know/are interested in is always a good thing but I don't really know how to start with just finding a good company to invest in that isn't at least being mentioned a little.

For everyone who doesn<U+0092>t want to read a wall of text there<U+0092>s a **TL:DR** at the bottom.

**Technical Setup:**

Canoo has completed its SPAC merger and ticker change a little over a month ago going from HCAC to GOEV. Ever since the combination it has been piled into by shorts. The short position has grown exponentially from 99k shares to over 10 million as of the last update by NASDAQ. I subscribe to S3 Capital<U+0092>s retail short algorithm which gives a more accurate current estimate of ~11 million shares short. New available shorts are nearly nonexistent and borrow rates are sky rocketing. If you haven<U+0092>t been living under a rock the past couple of weeks you already know how well short squeezes can play out.

[Share Borrow &amp; Fees](https://imgur.com/esZFBfL)

**Fundamental Setup:**

GOEV has a ton of positive catalyst the shorts are overlooking and I believe this will lead to large losses on their side. For one, the EV revolution is here to stay as you can tell from the new administration. Biden plans to electrify the whole federal fleet (estimated 650k vehicles). GOEV  has the perfect mid sized commercial B2B purpose built vehicle which fits the build of many government vehicles. The Canoo purpose built vehicle can replace for example USPS mail trucks.

[MPDV Purpose Built Vehicle](https://www.canoo.com/mpdv/) 

Canoo<U+0092>s leadership are veterans in the automotive industry which is hard to say for some of the other SPAC *cough * NKLA. Canoo's co-founder and CEO Ulrich Kranz was CTO at EV carmaker Faraday Future and more importantly has over 30 years of management experience at BMW. He worked to reimagine the MINI brand, develop the company's first SUV, and the iProject (BMW i8 &amp; i3). They also poached talent from Tesla; Sohel Merchant (vehicle architecture) Christoph Kuttner (vehicle trim), and Alexi Charbonneau (proprietary EV skateboard tech) just to name a few. 

The real value here is their proprietary B2B skateboard platform for EVs. Allowing for any automaker to design and build their perfect sedan and just clip on to an already existing powertrain. Now AAPL is most likely going to sign an EV production contract with Hyundai/KIA (expected as soon as Feb 17th) confirmed last night by the  3.6 Billion investment. GOEV is already providing their platform to Hyundai/KIA. GOEV has already been validated by AAPL as in AAPL wanted to buy them out in 2020 so clearly they like their tech. And if you think that<U+0092>s not enough to sell you on this theory then listen to this: In 2015, Apple almost used the BMW i3 as the basis for its Apple Car<U+0085> the two founders of Canoo were the top guys on the iProject. It doesn<U+0092>t take a genius to connect these dots.

When looking at different historical data, 10d vs 3m charts, if I don't change the interval on RSI or MACD or Bollinger Bands, why do I get different appearing grafts? 

Specifically when I am looking at AAPL (a company with obviously good fundamentals, so it takes that question out). On a 10d chart looking 60 minute intervals it's trading at a bottom of it's Bollinger Bands with a MCAD that looks like it's about to hit a buy signal and a bottom floor RSI. All of this to me says pick some AAPL up ASAP. 

However, when I change to a 3m chart, daily intervals, without changing the indicator settings, then it looks like MCAD and RSI are still trending down and I interpret that as possibly needing to wait longer to buy (specifically the MCAD given the increasing negative histogram).

Ok hear me out. I get it. It's Apple. I'm not denying that it is an absolute behemoth and both the market value and the book value are insane.

But despite the financials, part of me feels like AAPL is risky. It's becoming super clear that 1) the market is existing largely in its own world not related to actual book values and 2) social movements and cancel culture and ""the little guys"" are gaining traction and social sentiment goes a long way. 

I feel like the company's image isn't as shiny as it used to be. Self driving cars are cool but who is going to buy them? I'm not totally convinced that millenials/gen z are going to be climbing over each other to buy a new cars with Apple technology anytime soon.

Tomorrow, 23 February 2021 is the annual shareholders meeting. This is a good time to take a look at the ""Apple of my eye"", AAPL. Note, this is not an earnings report, but a shareholder meeting. More on that below. 

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Upside:\*\*

iPhone Sales - For the first time since 2016, Apple is #1 global smart phone sales. That means Apple has retaken their crown as the smartphone king. And this is all before 5G really takes over. I anticipate Apple iPhone sales to continue to perform well as 5G is rolled out globally. Strong smart phone sales continue to cement Apple as a very stable company, and situates them very well to continue expanding into other areas (hint hint Electric Vehicles).

Low volatility - considering the annual shareholder meeting is tomorrow, I am surprised to see that historic volatility is currently only 10%. This means options are relatively cheap.  In my opinion this opens the door for a speculative play here, where we can see call options increase in price due to delta (AAPL stonk price increasing, which has historically performed very strongly) as well as IV (volatility) increase due to speculation. Apple thus far has been relatively quiet on their future plans, and I believe if they hint at any information tomorrow during their shareholder meeting or in the near term, we will be eating tendies <U+0001F680> <U+0001F680> <U+0001F680>

\*\*Downside:\*\*

Lawsuit with Epic Games - This is still pending, and currently Epic Games filed a lawsuit against Apple in the EU for ""anti-trust"" reasons related to mobile games and the iOS app store. I am not a lawyer and don't claim to understand what's going on, so I can't speculate on what this would do to the stonk price. It's something to keep in mind when considering your risk tolerance.

\*\*Electric Vehicle (EV) Speculative Play:\*\* <U+0001F680>  <U+0001F680>  <U+0001F680>  

In my opinion, this is where the largest tendies will come from. There may be a huge speculative play here and I believe the combination of Apple being quiet on the topic while they work on the details (as per their normal playbook) as well as a general market sell off in response to recent market volatility (i.e. funds are selling off their AAPL to shift their gains to other areas to fight the market volatility), means we have a lower price AAPL stonk than I believe it should be. Basically, hedge funds are busy fighting in other areas of the market and can't allocate capital to speculate on Apple and are instead busy fighting the day to day fight in other stonks (GME?). 

The Electric Vehicle (EV) play - there have been reports of Apple looking for an EV partner in 2021, and my opinion is I expect news on Apple's EV play over the next 3-6 months, if not during annual shareholder meeting tomorrow. <U+0001F680> <U+0001F680> <U+0001F680> 

Of note, Foxconn which is Apples main chip producer, is releasing their own EV (independent of Apple) by EOY. In my view point, this means a major Apple partner who they have an extensive business relationship with already has the infrastructure and equipment in place to support an Apple EV play.

Most recently, Apple has been in early talks with car producers Kia as well as Hyundai. While nothing is official, this is evidence that Apple is exploring the EV market. 

But keep in mind, Apple is a technology company so they can provide a car manufacturer partner with EV technology using their top computer science talent. Using existing skill sets and projects already in development, Apple can provide operating systems, Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning, self driving technology, LiDAR sensors, etc. to the EV space. In my opinion this makes Apple a speculative EV play.

Sales grew a whopping 72% ($111.5B) in the previous quarter. They spent $5B last quarter on R&amp;D alone.

I point these numbers out as a reminder of how financially sound Apple is, which in my mind reduces the downside risk of any AAPL plays. 

In 2020 the board of directors had a target goal of $265B in net sales and they hit $274B. The operating income target was $61B and they hit $66B. Clearly this board of directors knows how to get results and meet targets.

Tomorrow, 23 February 2021 is the annual shareholders meeting. This is a good time to take a look at the ""Apple of my eye"", AAPL. Note, this is not an earnings report, but a shareholder meeting. More on that below.


**Upside:**

iPhone Sales - For the first time since 2016, Apple is #1 global smart phone sales. That means Apple has retaken their crown as the smartphone king. And this is all before 5G really takes over. I anticipate Apple iPhone sales to continue to perform well as 5G is rolled out globally. Strong smart phone sales continue to cement Apple as a very stable company, and situates them very well to continue expanding into other areas (hint hint Electric Vehicles).

Low volatility - considering the annual shareholder meeting is tomorrow, I am surprised to see that historic volatility is currently only 10%. This means options are relatively cheap. In my opinion this opens the door for a speculative play here, where we can see call options increase in price due to delta (AAPL stonk price increasing, which has historically performed very strongly) as well as IV (volatility) increase due to speculation. Apple thus far has been relatively quiet on their future plans, and I believe if they hint at any information tomorrow during their shareholder meeting or in the near term, we will be eating tendies <U+0001F680> <U+0001F680> <U+0001F680>

https://amp.ft.com/content/ee13ada3-a66a-4b3a-9def-bb308a800941


**Downside:**

Lawsuit with Epic Games - This is still pending, and currently Epic Games filed a lawsuit against Apple in the EU for ""anti-trust"" reasons related to mobile games and the iOS app store. I am not a lawyer and don't claim to understand what's going on, so I can't speculate on what this would do to the stonk price. It's something to keep in mind when considering your risk tolerance. Historically though it doesn't seem like anti-trust lawsuits have seemed to stop anyone, but I am open to other's thoughts here.

Instead they did so much stock buyback, and dividend payout instead of buying companies when they had the chance like TSLA, NFLX, others... Biggest AAPL acquisition was Beats headphone business lol Now there is talk of Apple car and Apple TV already sucks. Are they just wuss? what are they afraid of in buying successful business like their competitors. 

Even though apple is the biggest company right now, thinking long term 10-15 years from now. I actually think when its all set and done, I see AMZN and MSFT to be WAY bigger companies than AAPL.

Just go to any financial statistics website and look at the PE ratio of the majority of the stocks inside ETFS like QQQ. Their PE ratio and net revenue / cash flow to stock prices are not actually up but either stable or slightly lower. The only exception to this rule are meme stocks like TSLA, GME etc. AAPL is an exception too but AAPL's net revenue is quickly catching up. But ETFs and tech stock market in general are not in a bubble, you are looking at less than a handful of stocks to make this determination.

You guys are also forgetting that we are currently undergoing a technology revolution like never before. Covid-19 put technology in the forefront and it's like the invention of the steam engine right now. Everything in tech and the cyberspace in particular is literally going to skyrocket in the upcoming years. People who are going full time in right now will be the winners and history will know it. Jury is out for if these meme stocks are overvalued too because we don't know their future potential (TSLA, NIO etc - minority of the tech stocks). What is happening right now is that safe money is moving out of stocks and either into bonds or cash. Because of inflation cash is going to take a huge hit in a year or so when we finally have the figures for how much Covid-19 cost us in American dollars. So not only will people miss out on the huge gains post-tech revolution but they will also take a big hit for holding cash.

I am not going to say if I am a financial expert or not. It is common sense. But I was never a part of these PLTR, GME and TLRY ponzi schemes. These people are worse than the hedge funds because they are just as greedy but far less educated / invested. It was a pyramid scheme where the first guy in took the most gains. I don't believe in something like a store that sells physical copies of video games to ever succeed rofl. Let's not forget Gamestop offering $3 for a game they would later sell for $40. All you bozos did was bail out the assholes that were invested in an asshole company and had poor retail investors take the hit for it. You people took advantage of depressed anxious jobless individuals and now many of them are left without much. I took a big hit from TSLA too (silly me). But I do believe in the cyberspace taking off big time in the upcoming years and it'd be the most valuable resource imaginable. You are seeing news right now about tech stocks being in a bubble over and over. You are also seeing news about some bond bullshit going up. It's the news that wants you to get out so the big whales can go in cheap - right before Biden administration goes all in on the clean energy and tech sector. Tech in the 1990s was nothing like it is now. India and China did not know what computers were back then, now every person has an iphone and tiktok in their hands. Cars are running on cyberspace/cloud that did not exist back then. Revenue of tech companies dwarfes the oil giants. Currency itself is produced using technology (Cryptos). Globalism / latest tech and the cloud itself has become the most valuable resource not just in America but also in India and China which have 10x our population.

Over time, Apple has been a pioneer in the way humans work with computers. Although it isn't always at the head of the innovation curve, no company has had a more dramatic impact on the way humans and machines interact.

As TFI Asset Management analyst Ming-Chi Kuo pointed out in a research note released over the weekend, Apple popularized the mouse and graphical user interface for computers, the iPod click wheel, and multi-touch functionality for the iPhone and iPad. And he says Apple can lead the way in the next leap in computing interfaces: mixed and augmented reality.

""We believe that MR/AR will be the next critical technology to define the innovative human-machine interface for electronic products,"" Kuo wrote in the note. ""We believe that MR/AR will provide innovative visual experiences and redefine human behavior in creating, processing, and receiving information, which is why Apple is highly committed to MR/AR. One of Apple's advantages is defining the innovative human-machine interface, so we are taking a positive view of Apple's future in MR/AR.""

Kuo argued that in the long run, MR/AR interfaces will replace all display-equipped electronic products. Apple's strategy will unfold in three stages, he predicted.

He expects Apple to launch a helmet for virtual and augmented reality experiences by mid-2022. Kuo says the helmet will be equipped with Sony-built Micro-OLED displays and various optical modules to provide a ""video see-through AR experience,"" but with the ability to offer virtual-reality experiences as well.

He thinks the price tag of the helmet will be similar to that of high-end iPhones, at about $1,000. Kuo expects the contract manufacturer Pegatron to produce the helmets.

""Although Apple has been focusing on AR, we think the hardware specifications of this product can provide an immersive experience that is significantly better than existing VR products,"" he wrote. ""We believe that Apple may highly integrate this helmet with video-related applications (like Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, etc.) as one of the key selling points.""

Kuo said Apple's second product in this category will be MR/AR glasses. He doesn't think Apple has an existing prototype, and wrote that the glasses won't reach the market before 2025, at the earliest. Kuo thinks the glasses will be more specifically intended for augmented reality applications. ""We are looking forward to seeing the integration of glasses and Apple Car to provide an innovative user experience,"" he said.

Even farther out, in 2030 or later, he expects Apple to offer a contact-lens product with MR/AR capabilities. ""This product will bring electronics from the era of ""visible computing"" to ""invisible computing, "" he said.

Apple as a matter of policy doesn't discuss unannounced products, and hasn't addressed any of these potential devices. The stock was down 1.9%, to $119.18 on Monday morning.

The analyst said that, in 2023, Apple will introduce a telephoto lens design to the iPhone. This type of design helps to extend the focal length of a compact lens array, as per AppleInsider.

**Why It Matters:** Kuo had previously made the prediction regarding the telephoto lens design and given a timeline of 2022.

According to Kuo, Apple will also fine-tune iPhone<U+0092>s optics this year and make the move from glass to plastic cover materials for Face ID.

Company Fundamentals:

* From the above you'll see they have a commanding share of the true wireless headphone market. Any additional updates to the AirPods would be a great revenue generator. As much as people roasted the over the ear AirPods max...they're sold out everywhere and people were paying 2x the price to get them off eBay. 
* Looking below there is a steady increase in revenue from the iPad, Mac...and significant growth from ""other"" which would be your AirPods, that new AirTag and other accessories.

I'm thinking to put it all into either DIS or AAPL to maximize the gain. I'm looking medium to long term, and I can wear through storms like this one or the COVID crash back in March 2020 as I don't need this cash any time soon. Since my portfolio is already tech heavy, I think DIS makes more sense but I wanted to run it through this sub and pick on your brains.

Instead, I will cover why this is a good time to look at apple stock and what their future holds.

### Timing

At the start of this year, Apple stock was at $145 a share. It is currently down \~20% from that price, mostly due to the tech slump of the last few weeks.

It<U+0092>s worth noting that Apple isn<U+0092>t a company with a crazy valuation due to projected future earnings, it<U+0092>s already an absolute cash cow with solid current earnings, which makes this a safer investment than some of the more speculative tech plays.

Furthermore, this all time high price is one I feel will be surpassed in the future, given the future plans I will discuss below.

### Future

Apple has been a pioneer in the way humans interact and work with computers. While not always at the forefront of the innovation curve, The company has been able to revolutionise and disrupt sectors with their products.

The reason this has been so tremendously successful for Apple, for so long, is the seamless integration between their products, the <U+0091>ecosystem<U+0092>, which means that in a world of continuously more sophisticated technology, Apple<U+0092>s devices work and integrate seamlessly with each other, creating a highly rewarding customer experience.

This allows Apple to enter, or even create new markets *(think iPad or AirPods)* with a higher-than-usual success rate, while also being able to charge a higher premium for the Apple experience.

This higher success rate, along with big technology developments in the personal device space is the reason why I think Apple will sustain their position as a leading technology company.

**Augmented Reality**

Next up for Apple? mixed and augmented reality (MR and AR).

Augmented reality is the idea of overlaying projected imagery, graphics or instructions onto the real-world. Instagram face filters are an entertaining example of that, Mercedes<U+0092> current Sat Nav systems are a more useful use-case.

Apple are heavily investing into AR technology, with rumours of them releasing AR focussed glasses between later this year and 2022, future plans also suggest a 3 stage release of AR technology, starting with AR helmets and going all the way to contact lenses by 2030 *(this technology is closer than you think, look at this company who have working examples*[ *https://www.mojo.vision/*](https://www.mojo.vision/)*).*

**Apple car**

Slightly less sci-fi than AR, Apple has been working on a car since 2014, looking to release an autonomous driving model at around 2024.

I won<U+0092>t go into too much detail here on this as there is already tons of content online to read through, but a successful car launch can provide another massive revenue stream for Apple to grow even further.

**Summary**

Strong future outlook, solid established earnings, a loyal consumer and a reduced current price make buying the world<U+0092>s most popular stock a very interesting prospect.

**Apple Inc** [AAPL 2.37%](https://benzinga.com/stock/aapl#NASDAQ) is likely to use an approach similar to one it uses to make the iPhone for manufacturing its rumored electric vehicle, Bloomberg [reported](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-11/apple-tilts-to-iphone-playbook-for-car-as-automaker-talks-stall?sref=TBDibEcD) Wednesday.

**What Happened:** The Tim Cook-led company may work with a contract manufacturer after talks with some automakers did not bear fruit.

For making computers, smartphones, and tablets, the Cupertino, California-based company partners with manufacturers such as **Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. Ltd** [HNHPF 1.72%](https://benzinga.com/stock/hnhpf#OTC), better known as Foxconn, as well as<U+00A0>Pegatron, Wistron, **Flex Ltd** [FLEX 3.33%](https://benzinga.com/stock/flex#NASDAQ), and Luxshare. Profit margins of contract suppliers are dwarfed by those of Apple as factories are low-margin businesses.

**Why It Matters:** The contract manufacturing approach allows Apple to avoid expenses related to construction, salaries, training, and other sundry expenses noted Bloomberg.

Last month, EV talks between Apple and Korea<U+0092>s **Hyundai Motor Company** [HYMTF 0.76%](https://benzinga.com/stock/hymtf#OTC) [fell through](https://www.benzinga.com/news/21/02/19525004/apple-reportedly-has-suspended-electric-car-talks-with-hyundai-kia).

Apple was also said to be in discussions at the time with **General Motors Company** [GM 0.75%](https://benzinga.com/stock/gm#NYSE) and **Stellantis NV** [STLA 0.45%](https://benzinga.com/stock/stla#NYSE).

**Nissan Motor Co., Ltd** [NSANY 0.34%](https://benzinga.com/stock/nsany#OTC) also had fleeting contact with the iPhone maker but discussions did not reach fruition as the latter did not want to take a step down from being an [automaker to a hardware supplier.](https://www.benzinga.com/news/21/02/19665954/apple-talked-ev-tie-up-with-nissan-but-concerns-over-automaker-becoming-foxconn-came-in-the-way-ft)

The tech stocks that led the market higher in 2020 are faring worse this year. Wedbush sees it as a perfect opportunity to scoop up the group's biggest name.

Investors gearing up for a swift economic rebound have recently dumped growth stocks for riskier plays. The broad rotation to value stocks has dragged on tech mega-caps and sparked wild shifts between heavy selling and sudden dip-buying. While the Nasdaq composite notched a massive 3.7% gain on Tuesday, the biggest tech stocks still boast year-to-date losses.

The weakness sets up a ""great entry point"" for investors interested in [**Apple**](https://markets.businessinsider.com/stocks/aapl-stock?utm_source=markets&amp;utm_medium=ingest), Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said in a note. The firm added Apple to its ""best ideas"" list on Wednesday, praising the company's blowout December-quarter results and growth in Asia. After exceeding expectations for iPhone 12 sales, the iPhone 13 could be a ""game-changer"" that extends the upgrade ""supercycle"" for another year, Ives said.

""The recent sell-off creates a golden buying opportunity with a $3 trillion valuation on the horizon for Cupertino in our opinion,"" he added.

Wedbush reiterated its ""outperform"" rating with a $175 price target. The firm also holds a bull-case target of $225, which implies an 86% surge from Tuesday's closing level.

Wall Street expects Apple to ship roughly 220 million iPhones in the current fiscal year. Ives holds a considerably rosier outlook, instead projecting sales can rise to a record 250 million.

The bullish estimate is partially fueled by expectations for millions of current iPhone owners to upgrade their phones throughout the year. Some 350 million of the 950 million iPhones worldwide are due for an upgrade, according to Wedbush. The dynamic stands to prop up demand into the fall, Ives said.

The upgrade supercycle could even last through 2022 if iPhone 13 rumors prove true, the analyst added. Supply chain reports signal Apple initially aims to build 100 million units of the upcoming model, up from 80 million for the iPhone 12 lineup.

While this number is subject to change, the reports hint at ""an increased confidence with Cook &amp; Co. that this 5G product cycle"" will continue into next year, Ives said.

Apple closed at $121.08 on Tuesday, down 9.4% year-to-date. The company has 81 ""buy"" ratings, 15 ""hold"" ratings, and three ""sell"" ratings from analysts.","Apple is a 'best idea' pick that can rally up to 86% as tech stocks rebound, Wedbush says $AAPL",Company Discussion,2453017.0,1.0,2022-01-31 09:20:00,stocks,2021-03-12,2021-03-12,119.34725960783976,120.11052362854213,118.11810391776562,119.97174835205078

The analyst says that, based on analysis, aggregate iPhone demand in 2021 and 2022 should be relatively stable. He doesn't believe there's a ""supercycle"" materializing, but he did raise his 2021 iPhone shipment forecast to 220 million, up from 215 million.

I realize never is pushing it, but I'm 47 and so for me never may be literally true.  My portfolio now consists of about 19% AAPL and MSFT and I got to thinking if I had to worry about this .

I thought what if Microsoft or Apple ever went bankrupt and I lose 19% of my portfolio?!

Then I thought - Could either REALLY go bankrupt?

My answer was for all intents and purposes - NO NEVER.

Am I right for the most part?

I tell myself that as long as I get 10% a year from either of them I'm ok.  Heck even 5% is more than my bank account!  Although I think I should hopefully get a little better than that.

So REALISTICALLY . Do you think either of these companies will totally go out of business in the next 10 years or so?

#The Spreadsheet

To aid us in planning our trades, [**I<U+0092>ve compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qQTzoK79TEXtzRRmS3zILL-OkosPQ_CJqGrmMlsxp4o/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn<U+0092>t indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you<U+0092>re struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn<U+0092>t working for you, refer to the link below!

&amp;nbsp;

Please note that scraping and compiling this data took *hours*. If the sheet helped you out in any way, please drop an upvote or a comment, it would mean alot to me. Most websites also require you to pay for this data, which I think is a load of shit.

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I<U+0092>ve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&amp;nbsp;

- **Enphase fucking MOVES! On average, the magnitude of any given move for it is 15%**!!! An awesome play here would be a long straddle, or reverse iron butterfly. You don<U+0092>t know which way it<U+0092>s gonna move, but you do know that wherever it does, it<U+0092>s gonna fly.

Here is a small part from the article I found regarding upcoming Apple earnings: ""

 Apple could crush Street estimates, writes Morgan Stanley analyst Katy Huberty, who has an Overweight rating and a $158 price target on the stock, up 17% from Monday<U+0092>s close of $134.72. She sees the top line above $80 billion, with all segments growing at least 19% year over year. She is especially bullish on Mac and iPad sales, with estimates far above consensus<U+0097>53% for Macs and 52% for iPads. She also expects Apple to increase its dividend by 10% and expand its stock repurchase program by $60 billion.

I fucking love earnings season. It<U+0092>s an absolute battleground out there. Insane volatility, breaking announcements, and huge moves being made every single day for weeks at a time. What<U+0092>s not to love? Anyone has a chance to pick the correct tickers, roll the dice, and amass a small fortune. That being said, the unpredictable nature of earnings season often makes or breaks traders - many find that they<U+0092>re one bad trade away from a complete blowout, so you always need to think about each trade critically. No shame in sitting it out altogether.

This week, more so than others, is extra spicy, with all of $FAAMG (I kicked out Netflix for Microsoft after their disgusting showing last week) reporting alongside loads of other mega cap companies. There is a *stupid* amount of money to be made this week, for traders of all skill levels and styles.

#The Spreadsheet

To aid us in planning our trades, [**I<U+0092>ve compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qQTzoK79TEXtzRRmS3zILL-OkosPQ_CJqGrmMlsxp4o/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn<U+0092>t indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you<U+0092>re struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn<U+0092>t working for you, refer to the link below!

Please note that scraping and compiling this data took *hours*. If the sheet helped you out in any way, please drop an upvote or a comment, it would mean alot to me. Most websites also require you to pay for this data, which I think is a load of shit.

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I<U+0092>ve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&amp;nbsp;

- **Enphase fucking MOVES! On average, the magnitude of any given move for it is 15%**!!! An awesome play here would be a long straddle, or reverse iron butterfly. You don<U+0092>t know which way it<U+0092>s gonna move, but you do know that wherever it does, it<U+0092>s gonna fly.

- Although a relatively young company resulting in less data points, **Pinterest also moves with similar magnitude**. You could consider doing something similar on this ticker as well if you think these premiums are better.

- At the opposite end of the spectrum, we<U+0092>ve got stocks that *dont* move whatsoever during earnings season. The IV on these tickers is unreasonably jacked up for no good reason, so we can look to *sell* options on them to amass a small fortune. **Sirius XM, General Dynamics, CME Group, etc, all don<U+0092>t really move, but the options are priced as if they are going to anyways**. Use this to your advantage.

Given the GME interest, here is an investment idea.  Sony makes &amp; sells games direct to consumers, without relying on a middle man (like Apple).

They're also into VR (and make &amp; supply the small OLED displays that power VR headsets &amp; viewfinders).  

Sony has a well established music &amp; movie studios.  They  recently signed large streaming deals with Netflix and Disney.

Sony is also the top producer of image sensors - from mobile phones (iPhone) to high end cameras (they also produce their own line of stills &amp; cinema cameras and lenses) to industrial sensors for cars &amp; other machinery (ahem MVIS).

In addition to car sensors, they are now road testing their own EV - way ahead of Apple and many of the recent TSLA-wannabe startups.  They are a key supplier for other companies (Apple, Nikon, Panasonic, et al.) and they use their parts for their own products (the competition helps to subsidize their own products like Samsung).

3632,3632,AAPL,n6iv0d,Good_vibes311,0,1,"Fundamental Research released a new report on Apple Inc. Here are some highlights of the report: 

&amp;#x200B;

 Q2 (quarter ended March 2021) revenue beat market estimates by 16%, and our estimate by 7%. Earnings beat market estimates by 42% and our estimates by 11%. Declared a cash dividend of $0.22 per share (payable in May), up 7% QoQ.

Growth primarily came from strong sales of the new iPhone 12 and Mac/iPad sales due to work-from-home and remote learning environments caused by the pandemic.

We believe one of the strongest points of Q2 was a significant increase in the adoption of Apple products. First-time buyers accounted for close to 50% of global Mac sales and two-thirds in China. 

Service revenue grew 27% YoY. Apple has over 660M paid subscriptions, up 6% QoQ.

We feel that Q2 will be a tough quarter to beat, which will impact investors<U+0092> sentiment/excitement towards the stock. Apple has already warned investors that Q3 will be relatively weak. In addition, a potential reduction in work-from-home/remote learning from the vaccine rollout means that Apple is unlikely to report similar growth in the coming quarters.",Apple Inc.

Overview

Apple designs, manufactures and markets smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories, and sells a variety of related services. The company has two revenue generating segments: Products and Services. Apple<U+0092>s business primarily runs on its Products division which contains its flagship iPhone. However, the Services portfolio that includes revenues from cloud services, App store, Apple Music and Apple Pay is fast growing.

Reasons to buy

<U+0095> Super cycles: As of April 28 2021, Apple reported record quarterly revenue of $89.6 billion, up 54 percent year over year, driven by strength in its Products division. The company is expected to continue benefiting from its iPhone 12 super cycle which is its first 5G supported iPhone. Additionally, as we emerge from the pandemic the company will be able to re-open its retail stores globally driving further sales across its products division.

<U+0095> Innovation: Apple has shown tremendous innovation over the years and has developed new revenue streams effectively to diversify away from iPhone revenues. The company is rumored to be considering a move into autonomous vehicles and augmented reality/virtual reality which presents future growth opportunities in the long term.

<U+0095> App store: Apple<U+0092>s App Store ecosystem facilitated over half a trillion dollars in commerce in 2019. Apple is expected to benefit strongly from the flourishing app economy as technological adoption increases.

<U+0095> $90 billion share repurchase program: Apple has recently approved an increase of $90 billion to its existing share repurchase program which will support EPS growth in 2021. Apple has a strong balance sheet and generates significant cash flow and has rewarded investor generously over the last few years.

Reasons to sell

<U+0095> Competition: Apple<U+0092>s fortunes are tied to its most important offering, the iPhone. The device plays an important role in expanding the iOS ecosystem. However, Apple<U+0092>s excessive dependence on iPhone is a risk to overall growth. Although iPhone sales have been benefiting from higher average selling price (ASP), premium pricing has been blamed for Apple<U+0092>s declining market share in countries like China and India. Moreover, the smartphone segment has intensifying competition from Samsung, Huawei and Xiaomi.

Counter argument: Apple has been diversifying its revenues from the iPhone with growth in its Services segment. Apple also has other products/services in the pipeline which will further diversify its revenues.

<U+0095> Regulation: Apple is facing increasing regulatory hassles in Europe and is accused of being a monopoly. The European Commission is opening two antitrust investigations into Apple<U+0092>s App Store and Apple Pay practices over concerns that the company<U+0092>s way of doing business hurts consumers by limiting choice and innovation and keeping prices high.

Counter argument: Apple<U+0092>s App Store faces competition from Google Play Store, Microsoft Store and all other browsers.

Is there anyone who could take a look at my analysis of AAPL stock? Now I do not know any of the indicators, this is purely based on my first impression on the chart employing the EW analysis I have been studying. 

Any opinion will be greatly appreciated, please help this boy out!

Please ignore the small writings, as they are basically me rambling to myself- 

 so in short, I think that the wiggly price action after wave 3 is wave 4 manifesting in a triangle, almost coming to an end, ready for a breakout to fib extension 1 of wave 1.   
I did also consider the sharp low after the wave 3 being the wave 4, but since it is too sharp in relation to the wave 2 and it took such a short time to do so, I figured it would be more reasonable to consider it wave A of a triangle, and so far the trend lines are supporting my theory. 

If it does breakout below C, then I would think that it might be the wave A of a correction, which could possibly retrace all the way back to somewhere between the extreme of wave 1 and wave 4, and that whole impulse being the wave 1 of a strong uptrend. 

This is my possible anticipation, it might sound absolutely stupid to some of you Elliotticians, as it has been only three days since I've started studying EW, and I don't know anything else about trading, this is the first point of my study. So please do give me generous criticism, how to improve! I tremendously appreciate your time, thanks for reading this long ass post.

Also, this past week AAPL has been testing it's 200 day moving average. If we continue the rally strong from this area then it will invalidate the head and shoulders pattern outlined above.

Another point of interest is that the SlowRSI is currently @ 33.29. Typically a bottom is put in when this reaches the 20 level or below. This itself is no reason for a pullback, but everything said put together strengthens the pullback argument.

3649,3649,AAPL,nk5zl6,PeekingPotato,18,1,"Hey there guys, I just started analyzing stocks more and I thought I<U+00B4>ll try to do that and post it here. That<U+00B4>s my first analysis that I post anywhere. If you have any feedback for me that would be great and highly appreciated. If you have questions feel free to ask, I<U+00B4>ll try to answer everything. 

&amp;#x200B;

Today we will look through the basics of Apple<U+00B4>s business and then see if we can come up with a fair value for Apple<U+00B4>s stock using discounted free cashflow. 

This is not financial advice and I personally own shares in Apple. Nevertheless I will try to stay as unbiased and objective as I can.

First let<U+00B4>s review their different revenue streams. Their biggest stream, around **50%** of their sales comes from the **iPhone**. The **Mac** makes up around **11%**, the **iPad** around **9%**, **Services** around **19%** and **Wearables, Home and Accessories** around **11%**. 

For the valuation: 

We take **analyst estimates**, we discount that by our **required return of 8%**. Then we use the **perpetual growth rate of 2,5%** and that gave us a fair value for Apple<U+00B4>s stock of **$90 per share**. But because we have to account for **Apple<U+00B4>s debt** as well, our **fair value of equity** would be **$86 per share**.

Now feel free to include a margin of safety to that. 

Because Apple<U+00B4>s price is higher right now, I don<U+00B4>t think buying more is a good idea. Although you can always dollar-cost-average. That<U+00B4>s where you invest every month the same amount.

Where I see Apple<U+00B4>s stock price in 5 years. We can calculate where the price might be in 5 years with the **Earnings Per Share (EPS TTM)**, the **Estimated Growth Rate** and the **Future P/E Value**. With this method I get a stock price of **$242 per share** which is higher than what it is now. 

What I<U+00B4>ll do. I believe in Apple. I think they will stay for a long time and innovate even more. That<U+00B4>s why, although the price is not where I would want it to be, I will continue to **dollar-cost-average**. That way I don<U+00B4>t mind the volatile market and hold for the longterm.

At today's WWDC Apple rolled out some updates to iCloud under the name iCloud+. Existing paid iCloud users are going to get those iCloud+ features for the same monthly subscription price.

In Safari, Apple is going to launch a new privacy feature called Private Relay. It sounds a bit like the new DNS feature that Apple has been developing with Cloudflare. 

When Private Relay is turned on, nobody can track your browsing history <U+0097> not your internet service provider, anyone standing in the middle of your request between your device and the server you<U+0092>re requesting information from.

Boomer's love, you use it, your wife uses it to call her boyfriend, and we all need it: yes, an iPhone, with 5G fresh dividend delivering cell service. **$T,** also known as AT&amp;T, is a telecommunications service provider valued at over $171.8 billion. $T made headlines recently for the announcement of the media merger/spinoff/conglomoreate/absolute market share take over with Discovery last month.

Prior to the Discovery deal, AT&amp;T paid an annual dividend of $2.08 per share, putting the stock's dividend yield at 6.45%. After the deal, they upped it to 7.23%, it isn't much when we make 1000% on what were about to discover, but remember, Boomers. Love. Dividends. a lot. You know what Boomers hate? Meme stocks. $T is a Boomer Stock, and once this fuckin rocket boomerang takes off, the 66 year old in retirement will tell all his buddies at the croquet club, and they will soak it all up, all of it. In fact, they will laugh in our faces and say: ""**that's why Warren told you to hold good stocks that pay dividends.""** Meanwhile, they don't know that we were the ones who really discovered the rocket ship fueling up on the launch pad.

**$AAPL bought Beats in 2014 for $3 billion**. A massive deal that changed the way we listen to Tupac and look at fly honeys at the gym. Hello Sunshine's deal is at a valuation of over **$1 billion.** This is huge for $T. It means that $T will not only own Shark Week, Naked and Afraid, but also **ALL** of HBO, and now **ALL** Sunshine Media Company's huge hits. **ALONG WITH A DEAL WITH $AAPL. BOOMERS WILL EAT THIS UP, ABSOLUTELY DEMOLISH IT AT THE TENNIS CLUB.** Once this deal is set, it's off to the races, and it's happening FAST, get on the $T rocket cause it's fueling up in Tim Apple's front yard.

TLDR; **$T has over 201,240 OI on 7/16 $30c and 143,000 OI on 9/17 $30c.** Besides the ex-dividend being paid tomorrow, there has to be some knowledge of the upcoming possibility of a deal with $AAPL.","$T is primed for take-off, the discovery I found that ties Steve Jobs widow Laurene Jobs to Sunshine Media Company which $T owns a huge stake in, possibly a deal by $AAPL, and other info from the options chain .

What's poppin' bull gang, I hope you made some awesome money last week! The spreadsheet was spot on for nearly every company, and all of my plays came to fruition! **$MT and $X ended up bagging us anywhere from 300% to 500%, $JETS gave us 1100%, and $SNAP netted us 250% on our strangles and nearly 600% on binary options!** I<U+0092>m looking to keep this momentum going throughout this week as well, and with all of FAAMG (I kicked $NFLX out for $MSFT after their disgraceful earnings) set to report, this week could prove to be more lucrative than the last! We<U+0092>ve got a large variety of trades we can make this week ranging from educated gambles, to good old fashioned theta plays. We<U+0092>ve even have a couple of opportunities to sprinkle in some collateral plays if we wish! Let<U+0092>s get into it!

#The Spreadsheet
To aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-xx9rsQ4_0LhDRqfBbW4wkSy5zRdVOBHQn737EC5Cok/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn<U+0092>t indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you<U+0092>re struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn<U+0092>t working for you, refer to the link below!

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I<U+0092>ve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&amp;nbsp;

- **Pinterest is inefficiently priced.** Since going public, $PINS has had an average post earnings move of **14%**. The options this week are pricing in a move of *roughly 6%* on both sides of the chain, which is likely going to shrink significantly going into earnings as theta eats away at the contracts. Even though I<U+0092>m extremely bullish on $PINS, this trade could honestly move either way, so I<U+0092>m personally opting to play a straddle like I did with $SNAP last week. Given that we get a historically average move, we<U+0092>ll be making some money on this trade. Keep in mind, this trade *is* riskier than the one we played on $SNAP, since the average historical move is smaller. Don<U+0092>t over leverage yourself, and don<U+0092>t be afraid to turn the straddle into a reverse iron butterfly to reduce your cost basis on the trade.

&amp;nbsp;

- **Over the past 24 earnings seasons, Shopify has gone up nearly 75% of the time!** The odds on this trade are phenomenal, and we have quite a few options for how we want to play it.  If you want to gamble directionally, call debit spreads would be your best bet from a risk to reward standpoint. Alternatively, we can also join theta-gang for this play by selling ATM put credit spreads allowing us to net some extremely nice premiums. If you want an even safer spread, $MSFT also has a similar win-rate (~65%) while having a historically smaller move, allowing you to defend your capital in the event that the trade goes against you. Since both $SHOP and $MSFT report on different days, we can look to make this play twice to ensure we<U+0092>re not overleveraged on any given day.

&amp;nbsp;

- **Counterintuitively, $XLE is NOT a good [collateral play](https://www.hungrybotalerts.com/blog/collateral-plays) this week!** $XLE actually has a *higher* IV than both $XOM and $CVS, so if you wanted to play oil earnings, you<U+0092>d actually be better off rolling the dice on the individual companies. I<U+0092>m not sure why this is the case here. Either the MMs are catching onto my bullshit (unlikely), or there<U+0092>s some nuances to trading oil that I<U+0092>m not aware of.  I<U+0092>m sure there<U+0092>s an arbitrage play you could make regarding the individual price and IV differences proportional to the ETF holdings, but I don<U+0092>t have time to crunch the numbers nor do I think I<U+0092>d have enough capital to abuse it. Regardless, I just wanted to bring this to everyone<U+0092>s attention since this is one of the rare cases where the collateral play puts us at a disadvantage.

&amp;nbsp;

All that being said, I haven<U+0092>t had much time to review any extra trades given that I<U+0092>ve been extremely busy this weekend. If you want extra trade theses or updates, alongside any live trade entries and exits, feel free to check out my Twitter or Discord! Links can be found in the sheet or on my profile.

#Summary and Conclusion

We<U+0092>ve got another fun week of earnings ahead of us! I personally tend to avoid playing FAANG stocks in general, so my analysis was concentrated elsewhere. If you see any appealing plays, feel free to let me know! Use the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-xx9rsQ4_0LhDRqfBbW4wkSy5zRdVOBHQn737EC5Cok/edit?usp=sharing) to determine which stocks offer the best risk to reward ratio, and play accordingly! If enough people find the sheet useful, I'll continue making them throughout the earnings season! If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please consider dropping an upvote or a comment!

Who is Kevin Lynch?

First off let<U+0092>s talk about Kevin Lynch who was named Apple Car Lead on July, 16 2021. Lynch has had many roles at Apple as well as Adobe and played a key role in the creation of Creative Cloud. The first leader of the Apple Car Development program was Bob Mansfield (retired in 2020) followed by John Giannandrea (Apple AI and machine learning chief) finally followed by Lynch. 


State of Apple Car

As of July 16th 2021 it is rumored that Apple is now sourcing components, talking with suppliers, and making deals with manufacturing partners for the Apple Car. Still in the early stages the Apple Car is rumored to hit the market between 2025 and 2028. 


Lucid Group + Kevin Lynch

Michael Bell (Lucid Senior VP of Digital) - 16 years at Apple of which includes significant roles in development of iPhone, iMac, AirPort, and Apple TV. Bell and Lynch worked together closely on the development of iMac. 

Margaret Burgraff (Lucid VP of Software Validation) - 15 years at Apple of which includes working on the development and launch of the original iMac with you guessed it Kevin Lynch

Sir Johny Ive (Operating Partner for Spac now LCID) - Designer of iMac where he worked closely with Kevin Lynch. 


Lack of Denial April 3rd 2021

Peter Rawlinson (Lucid CEO) was asked point blank in an interview with The Guardian, if he had been approached by or was currently engaged in negotiations with Apple on a partnership for the Apple Car, in which he declined to comment. Per the NYSE rules false rumors must be promptly denied or clarified this would suggest they are true, but not at a point in which either company can release a statement. 


Conclusion 

In my opinion an Apple + Lucid partnership is still very likely giving the lack of denial and the connections between high ranking Lucid employees and Kevin Lynch, but with a go to market target of 2025-2028 it could still be months before we receive an update on a potential partnership. I am long $LCID and continue to hold.

3752,3752,AAPL,ox49c1,DarthTrader357,14,1,"I'm leaning toward GS because it has a few unique characteristics going for it. It's IV is good - on par with Tech, it's price is high which raises premium further, unlike AAPL and MSFT it isn't making giant runs which makes it harder to predict, and it also pays out \~2.3% dividend which acts like a keel to price fluctuation.

Right now the annualized return for 15.9% in premiums on GS is at 0% chance of being assigned. I think Probability calculators are a bit wonky though so I look at the gamma weighted strikes and most of the weight is around 375, which means for a \~16% annualized return on bi-weeklies you have a very high chance (even with the delta around 0.30) of not even getting assigned or getting assigned near a top that you can buy back in at or wait for a dip.

MSFT is \~45% probability of assignment for 11.4% annualized return.

AAPL is about the same (trading in tandem) and about 12.8% annualized return.

So I think GS has a pretty strong, relatively risk free, money pi<f1>ata that largely unable to be seen unless you look at the options chains and the Greeks.

Given their dividend payouts are small - MSFT and AAPL both have to make up an approximately 6% gap in return on their share price if you take the risk of \~45% assignment to earn the annualized rate of return on premiums mentioned above. And I think that may be do-able, by share price both AAPL and MSFT are juggernauts of return.

But, then it comes down to if ones strategy should be to seek out ores of premium. And GS somehow seems to fall into a vein of gold.

A bit about the sector differences. I think Tech is waning into a mature state for the supposed bull run of the fall-to-spring season. But, given the inflationary environment, banks are tee'd well for a stronger-than-average bull run.

I've read differing opinions on why future rate hikes aren't raising the 10yr rate over the 2yr rate yet, and the argument I lean upon is the liquidity that a lot of big players are sitting on, they are still gobbling up the 2years driving their prices up relatively to 10year.

When that changes, the banks positions (less so GS but it trades tandem) will be much stronger than it appears now.",Is Goldman Sachs a better return.

Everything Apple has been doing lately has me thinking it's likely to fall soon due to their upcoming security changes. I'm have a relatively small position 10 shares at 127.96. So I won't be making a huge profit but I do think Apple might be a buy in the future when its cheap again. I like Apple products but their security update is seriously having many people globally hesitant to the stance the brand is taking. Is it time to take profits?

So let me begin with some TA or as I like to call it SA (Stonk Astrology) 

[$AAPL 1 day 2 year chart](https://preview.redd.it/7xofx6igqog71.png?width=2306&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6fbdf6d7840b1e2f3c51c6ed2a0910dbd8bdc6a8)

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img r87pwpn3rog71...*

&amp;#x200B;

 What am I looking at? You might be asking and that's a decent question. So let me explain first starting with the 1 day/ 2 year chart. This chart I'm using to show that Apple tends to have its run ups preceding earnings. On that note if you have ever been wondering why you always get IV crushed at earnings its because Apple is so reliably profitable and has grown so consistently throughout its life span that Wall Street tends to price in that Apple will meet or exceed expectations well before they actually announce. This tends to be the pattern for most of the mega cap stocks that are highly globalized and have monopolistic tendencies. (think: MSFT AMZN GOOGL probably). 

 This second graph is the more important one as it actually shows actionable data. If you direct your goldfish-like attention to the 1 hour 30 day chart you can take a look at some things that I have laid out. 

1.)  The orange lines: they form a triangle if you didn't notice that than you definitely shouldn't be trading stocks, but if you have gotten far enough to identify a triangle than you can probably handle the idea of a breakout. As these triangles form they general lead to a breakout from the triangle formation and on to higher, highs or lower, lows. that's it, not that hard to understand

2.) Purple Lines: Just a trace of the prices to better visualize the patterns forming 

3.) Blue Lines: Simple moving avg I set my 3 moving avgs. to 20, 50, and 200, When the cross or spread out  they can help identify downturns or breakouts respesctively. 

4.) Red Lines: this is a fib retracement which uses the fib. sequence to help identify support and resistance levels between the highs and lows of and stock and beyond. The fib. retractions are the most difficult to explain because simply put I literally have no idea why prices using fib. levels as support and resistance. That being said, my research indicated to me that no one else could really explain it either, whether or not prices actually act this way or since everyone uses fib sequences that we cause price to act that way. Either way I have found these work really well when Identifying support and resistance. 

 Studies: I'm just going to clump these into to the same category but these are the charts that you seen on the bottom first one is volume, second one is the ATR which is relative volatility, and MACD which helps indicate refeversals and RSI which helps identify overbought and oversold conditions 

 The trade: so what this chart is telling me is that $AAPL has been consolidating for some months and could break out to new highs. What I am going to do is buy the oct 15 $155 call or the sept 17 $155 call if you are feeling confident like me. Something important I forgot to mention above is that $AAPL's implied volatility is not only historically low but also below the historical one year avg. What this means is that not only will your call option increase in value due to the run up in price but the run up IV that is likely to happen will compound your gains. Why is this likely to happen simply the law of averages? 

&amp;#x200B;

[$AAPL IV vs. historical IV ](https://preview.redd.it/n03w9whpzog71.png?width=1914&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b2505c6046090849e450eb4a84371f36fcad1235)

 Couple of notes: first I am not a financial advisor just a dude with a hobby, second obviously TA is a good look into what has happened historically it doesn't guarantee that it will happen. That being said, if this TA begins to bring down I would look at the $143.50 level as confirmation and as for confirmation on the upside you should look for the previous high of $150. To make this trade successful you might want to consider staggering your buys instead of the traditional balls deep all at once. For an example I have already entered this trade with 10 shares at an avg. of $147 and a sep. 17 $155 call at the same price. I plan to buy more 155 calls for both sept and oct. as the price drifts up to $150 if all goes to plan I am looking at a pt of around $160 

TLDR: I thing this is the begining of the apples run up before q3 earnings sep 17 $155 calls

What are some other good buyback stocks? I recently learned that 252 companies in S&amp;P are doing buybacks, first time in history that the majority of them are doing so. But I want BIG, steady buybacks for my value LEAPs.

#### Now, a few words on the criteria I<U+0092>m using and sources of data.

**1. TheStreet score**

The first filtering step is to get stocks with Buy recommendation at TheStreet stock screener. I<U+0092>m only keeping stocks with A+, A or A- rating (top ones), although A-, B+, B and B- are Buys as well.

From thestreet.com:

***A (Excellent)*** *<U+0096> The stock has an excellent track record for maximizing performance while minimizing risk, thus delivering the best possible combination of total return on investment and reduced volatility. It has made the most of the recent economic environment to maximize risk-adjusted returns compared to other stocks. While past performance is just an indication <U+0097> not a guarantee <U+0097> we believe this fund is among the most likely to deliver superior performance relative to risk in the future as well.*

And about the methodology (source: https://www.thestreet.com/r/ratings/reports/detail/T.html):

*TheStreet Ratings<U+0092> stock model projects a stock<U+0092>s total return potential over a 12-month period including both price appreciation and* ***dividends****. Our Buy, Hold or Sell ratings designate how we expect these stocks to perform against a general benchmark of the equities market and interest rates. While our model is quantitative, it utilizes both* ***subjective*** *and* ***objective*** *elements. For instance, subjective elements include expected equities market returns, future interest rates, implied industry outlook and forecasted company earnings. Objective elements include volatility of past operating revenues, financial strength, and company cash flows.*

**2. Zacks Rank**

It is required that the Zacks Rank is Hold, Buy or Strong Buy (so we<U+0092>re avoiding stocks with Sell and Strong Sell recommendations). The Zacks Rating utilizes a completely different system, based on company earnings-related data, in particular earnings estimate revisions and earnings surprises, to predict profitability of holding the company<U+0092>s shares. More from https://www.zacks.com/education/stock-education/zacks-rank-guide-6:

*A portfolio of Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks has beaten the market in 26 of the last 31 years with an average annual return of* ***+24.3%*** *a year; more than double that of the S&amp;P 500<U+0092>s +10.6% .*

**3. Weiss Ratings recommendation**

We<U+0092>re only keeping stocks with Buy (B) or Strong Buy (A) recommendation.

Wjat are these scores? This is what I found at their website:

*<U+0093>A<U+0094> Rating:* ***Excellent.*** *The company<U+0092>s stock has an excellent track record for providing strong performance with lower-than-average risk, and it is trading at a price that represents good value relative to the company<U+0092>s earnings prospects. While past performance is no guarantee of future results, our opinion is that this stock is among the most likely to deliver superior performance relative to risk in the future. Of course, even the best stocks can decline in a down market. But our <U+0093>A<U+0094> rating can generally be considered the equivalent of a <U+0093>****Strong Buy****<U+0093>.*

*<U+0093>B<U+0094> rating:* ***Good.*** *The company<U+0092>s stock has a good track record for delivering a balance of performance and risk. While the risk-adjusted performance of any stock is subject to change, our opinion is that this stock is a good value, with good prospects for outperforming the market. Although even good investments can decline in a down market, our <U+0093>B<U+0094> rating is considered the equivalent of a <U+0093>****Buy****<U+0093>.*

**4.  Yahoo Finance  recommendation and target price**

It is required that the Yahoo Finance stock recommendation is at least mixed Buy/Hold from experts. Additionally, the predicted target price (average, from experts) should be at least 5% higher than the current one.

**5. Piotroski F-Score**

The Piotroski score is a number between 0-9 that reflects nine criteria used to determine the strength of a company<U+0092>s financial situation, including profitability, leverage or operating efficiency. Zero is the worst value and nine is the best. As we can read in[ Piotroski<U+0092>s paper](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/9dc9/b030da18ab28d1e1a1bbf7e33fb5911f189e.pdf) from 2000:

*In addition, an investment strategy that buys expected winners and shorts expected losers generates a* ***23% annual return*** *between 1976 and 1996, and the strategy appears to be robust across time and to controls for alternative investment strategies.*

It is required that the score is 4 or higher. The values were retrieved from https://www.gurufocus.com.

**6. InvestorsObserver Overall Score**

The rank has a value in between 0 and 100. It takes into account both **technical** analysis and **fundamental** stock data. An Overall Rank of N means that a given company is rated above N% of stocks, therefore the higher the number, the better. My requirement is that the company has InvestorsObserver Overall score of at least 50.

*The Overall Score combines our two technical scores (Short Term and Long Term) with our Fundamental Score into one metric. This makes our overall score a great place to start when evaluating stocks, regardless of your investing style.*

*A low score doesn<U+0092>t necessarily mean a stock is likely to go down, just that our system doesn<U+0092>t think there<U+0092>s much of a bullish case for it.*

Please note that the company profile data (short description) was taken from  tradingview (sometimes I shortened it) and dividend data was retrieved from MarketBeat.

I hope you enjoyed the reading. What do you think about this stock selection and the strategy? Feel free to leave a comment below.

We have heard alot of rumors surounding Apple potentialy intergrating some of GSAT:s functionality in to the upcoming [iphone 13](https://fortune.com/2021/08/30/iphone-13-satellite-globalstar-stock-gsat/), that some sources claim is not going to happen. I tend to agree with the latter, but what I belive people are missing from the puzzle is the rumored new extreme version of the [Apple watch](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-26/apple-considers-launching-rugged-watch-for-extreme-sports), this is a product where GSAT intergration would make much more sense, and intergrating emergency beacon functionality to Extreme sporting watches has already been done by Breitling in their [Extreme watch](https://www.breitling.com/us-en/emergency/).

Alltough Apple watch might bring in as much revenue to GSAT as iphone 13 intregration would, im confindent that 37.5M every quarter in payment to GSAT is just the begining of the pontential cash flow from this product intergration.

Edit: If these mystery cashflows are going to be consistent 37.5M per qurater, that amounts to 150M every year. GSAT:s current revenue is 128M and the market value it at 4B$, if we assume that the market is pricing in around 17% Growth rate with a WACC of around 20% we get to the current valuation of 4B with today revenue. If we add in the extra 150M from this mystery customer and discount it with the same WACC and growth rate, we get to a valuation of 8.8B or a stock price of around 4.8. But if we say that this deal makes the market price in even more future growth, which i think it will, with a Growth of around 20% the valuation instead lands closer to 20B or 10$ per share.

3794,3794,AAPL,pjnheq,patrioticbets,1,1,"Good Morning Traders! Its another beautiful week to make some money and boy do we have a list for you! 
Now before we begin as always, I want to make sure that I say this, so no one comes after me so please read this carefully when I say if you don<U+0092>t have the money, or you don<U+0092>t want to lose money then please do not trade in the market and do not dump all your money into the stocks that are listed in this article! Just because I am writing about them does not guarantee they will go up, down or even move for that matter, the objective of this this weekly draft is to pick stocks that I think might have the best movement and potential, but with the stock market even with all the facts there is no guarantee that it will go your way. 
Now, lets get into it, to start off Adamis pharmaceuticals ($ADMP). Never heard of them? That<U+0092>s because they are not brother or sister to a company like Pfizer this is more like a second cousin once removed. Just trading at a low price of $1.11 you<U+0092>re most likely thinking why? Well, what they lack in price they make up in rumors and rumors have it that Adamis are currently in trials with an antiviral drug for upper respiratory infections such as asthma, influenza and covid-19 called tempol, they have already announced dosing patients and are on their II/III phase putting them directly under the microscope as a potential 10x if it goes that way.
Another unsuspecting stock is Alcoa Corp ($AA). Now ill admit this one is a bit of a no brainer, but I figured why not just be captain obvious for the people who may not always research their stocks before diving right in. The only reason I even came across this stock was because I was looking for information on Coco Cola and found that the beverage company is suffering from a shortage of cans and is having a hard time maintain the amount of aluminum. Furthermore, this isn<U+0092>t just in Coco Colas back door but its apparently a global issue with aluminum making it rarer and less accessible to everyone. The stock is currently trading at $47.21 and if the shortage continues its only going to drive the price of shares up. 
This next stock you know and love, its one of the top tech companies please put your hands together for Apple Corp everyone! ($AAPL) Is pretty much the dominating giant when it comes to phones in the west and Apple have continued to deliver with the new iPhone 13. What makes this release a shocker is that apple have hinted or maybe just confirmed at this point that the new iPhones will be able to use satellite communications making it essentially the first smart satellite phone to hit the market, what<U+0092>s interesting is that space corporations are jumping on this and a buddy of mine even said <U+0093>Looks like the astronauts are all getting iPhones now.<U+0094> A wild statement but not something I couldn<U+0092>t imagine apple wanting to dominate. First earth then the universe. Apple is trading as of right now just $154.30
Still rolling with communications next in line is apples former king the company that shaped my childhood and phone status with its beautifully designed flip phone, that<U+0092>s right next we have Motorola ($MSI) despite not being top shit when it comes to how cool your phone is Motorola has managed to stay afloat and prosper while not being in the spotlight. The company has shown tremendous earnings and revenue over the years and don<U+0092>t seem to be slowing in the growth and development department even with the uncertainty we live in today, trading at a decent $244.85 stock has taken a small dive but in the great words of capitalism buy low sell high. 
Okay, I need to come clean, I didn<U+0092>t want to put this in here just because of how much everyone talks about it already, but I could not pass it up. Tesla, that<U+0092>s right the real-life stark industries has made headlines once again thanks to the real-life Tony Stark Mr. Elon Musk. And what did Mr. Musk do? Oh, nothing just stated that Teslas shares could easily be worth $3000 a piece. Now for those of you who are saying big deal its just talk let me remind you that we are talking about a man that tweeted that Tesla<U+0092>s stock price was too high and by the end of the day Tesla<U+0092>s share price had shot down so many people were wondering if it was a crash all over again. The man literally made a crypto that was started as a joke rise to nearly .40 cents a coin when it was trading at .003 in just a few months. It may be nothing buts it<U+0092>s a nothing I can<U+0092>t ignore and that<U+0092>s why its on the list today. Tesla is currently trading at $733.57 a share. 
And there you have it the draft is over and well see what<U+0092>s in store for these stocks at the end of the week with the review that comes out after the market closes on Friday EST.

Today's top mentions include the #1 take-over by Apple that occurred over the last 30 minutes. Here they are:

&amp;#x200B;

* AAPL: Apple became the #1 stock mentioned on WSB at exactly 11:20am. What happened? The share price went from +0.50% to -3% in a matter of minutes. It's actually amazing how fast WSB is to take note of any action in the market. The correlating AAPL chart is below so you can see the change of mentions on the first chart vs the stock price.
* CLOV: This stock seems to have taken the #1 squeeze name on WSB. My theory is that AMC and GME are old news and now CLOV, which is seemingly under-valued from reaching almost $30 just a couple months ago, has the potential to fly again.
* CCJ: A new name on the list and kind of unusual for WSB (uranium play??). WSB knows the power of uranium since a lot of members are probably buying uranium ore and storing it under their pillow versus just buying the stock.
* AMC: AMC nothing new here.
* TSLA: Elon tweets are keeping this stock alive as traders patiently wait for the next gamma squeeze.

#The Spreadsheet
To aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nw-EaMcOUIY52zJtre6tYAYTw5YLKswl97Nkez_WQBA/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn<U+0092>t indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you<U+0092>re struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn<U+0092>t working for you, refer to [this link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nw-EaMcOUIY52zJtre6tYAYTw5YLKswl97Nkez_WQBA/edit?usp=sharing) instead!

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I<U+0092>ve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&amp;nbsp;

- **Jetblue is inefficiently priced.** Historically Jetblue moves roughly **4%** post earnings (inline with all the other American airlines),  yet this quarter, the options are pricing in a move of roughly **10%**. If we sell straddles or strangles, we can collect this extremely inflated premium with very little risk on our end. I looked into the entire sector as a whole since I planned on trading it last week, and I came across nothing that would<U+0092>ve fundamentally caused this spike in volatility in airlines, or Jetblue specifically. The odds are awesome on this trade, and I plan or robbing some gamblers next week. For more information on earnings pricing inefficiencies, refer to [this article.](https://www.hungrybotalerts.com/blog/pricing-inefficiencies-around-earnings)

&amp;nbsp;

- **Twitter is inefficiently priced. Avoid it.** Historical move of **6.5%**, priced move of **11%** - on paper, this trade gives us insane edge, but I<U+0092>m still not touching it, as we saw what happened with $SNAP on Thursday. Although Twitter dropped 5% as the market tried to price $AAPL<U+0092>s privacy policy in, I don<U+0092>t feel like taking on additional risk because the fundamentals have shifted right before its<U+0092> earnings. Normally I would take this trade 10/10 times simply from a pure numbers standpoint, but I<U+0092>m not as confident anymore because of the added volatility created by $SNAP. 

&amp;nbsp;

- **Oil stocks tend to experience Post Earnings Announcement Drift (PEAD).** PEAD is the phenomenon where a stocks price will drift in the direction of an earnings surprise for several weeks following an earnings announcement. If a stock beats, it will continue to grind up for weeks following the ER report, and vice versa if it misses. This is especially true among oil stocks - check the charts if you don<U+0092>t believe me. The best way to play oil this quarter would be to capitalize on this effect, and do **monthly** call or put debit spreads based on the results that come out Friday. To those curious, standard weekly options provide no edge at the time of writing, so it<U+0092>s best not to gamble this time round.

&amp;nbsp;

- **Collateral Plays are your friend!** If you<U+0092>re bullish on big tech, look to long $QQQ this week to alter your risk exposure and bag some safer gains. If you<U+0092>re bearish on oil, look to short $XLE instead of any of the individual companies for an added safety net. If you think $AMD is gonna knock it out of the park, look to play $NVDA or $SOXL instead. There<U+0092>s lot<U+0092>s of opportunities for collateral plays this week, and I<U+0092>ve just barely scratched the surface. If you wish to learn more about collateral plays, refer to [this article.](https://www.hungrybotalerts.com/blog/collateral-plays)

#Summary and Conclusion

We've got ourselves an awesome week of earnings this time round! There's many trades that have a great risk-reward ratio on them, which is extremely odd considering that playing earnings is usually a crapshoot. Use the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nw-EaMcOUIY52zJtre6tYAYTw5YLKswl97Nkez_WQBA/edit?usp=sharing) to determine which stocks offer the best risk to reward ratio, and play accordingly!

The company said it was taking a one-time litigation-related net charge of $766 million related to an $809.5 million settlement the company announced in September for allegedly misleading investors about user growth.

Here<U+0092>s what Twitter reported versus Wall Street<U+0092>s estimates:

* Earnings: 54-cent loss per share, adjusted.

* Revenue: $1.284 billion vs. $1.285 billion as expected by analysts polled by Refinitiv.

* Monetizable daily active users (mDAUs): 211 million vs. 211.9 million as expected by analysts polled by StreetAccount.

Because of the legal settlement, Twitter reported a net loss of $537 million, compared to a profit of $29 million a year ago.

Revenue increased 37% in the quarter from a year earlier. Twitter said the impact of Apple<U+0092>s iOS privacy change was less than expected in the period, and will be modest in the fourth quarter. Snap and Facebook both cited Apple<U+0092>s new iOS 14 privacy features as the main reason for business disruption in the latest quarter.

Twitter <U+0092>s ad revenue rose more than 41% to $1.14 billion, with total ad engagements increasing 6% from a year earlier.

[...]

Unlike Snap and Facebook, demand for Twitter<U+0092>s ads have not been impacted by global supply chain issues, Twitter CFO Ned Segal said in a call with analysts. This is because more than half of Twitter<U+0092>s ad revenue in 2021 are associated with services and digital goods, Segal said.

3881,3881,AAPL,r576vm,PeekingPotato,238,1,"Hey there guys, I just started analyzing stocks more and I thought I<U+00B4>ll try to do that and post it here. That<U+00B4>s my second analysis for AAPL, the last one was from May. If you have any feedback for me that would be great and highly appreciated. If you have questions feel free to ask, I<U+00B4>ll try to answer everything.

Today we will look through the basics of Apple<U+00B4>s business and then see if we can come up with a fair value for Apple<U+00B4>s stock using discounted free cashflow.

This is not financial advice and I personally own shares in Apple. Nevertheless I will try to stay as unbiased and objective as I can.

First let<U+00B4>s review their different revenue streams. Their biggest stream, around **50%** of their sales comes from the **iPhone**. The **Mac** makes up around **11%**, the **iPad** around **9%**, **Services** around **19%** and **Wearables, Home and Accessories** around **11%**.

For the valuation:

We take **analyst estimates**, we discount that by our **required return of 8%**. Then we use the **perpetual growth rate of 2,5%** and that gave us a fair value for Apple<U+00B4>s stock of **$99 per share**. But because we have to account for **Apple<U+00B4>s debt** as well, our **fair value of equity** would be **$94 per share**.

Now feel free to include a margin of safety to that.

With Apple<U+00B4>s price being at **$160** **per share** right now, it<U+00B4>s a little too high. That<U+00B4>s why I don<U+00B4>t think buying heavily is a good idea. Although you can always dollar-cost-average. That<U+00B4>s where you invest every month the same amount.

**Where I see Apple<U+00B4>s stock price in 5 years.** We can calculate where the price might be in 5 years with the **Earnings Per Share (EPS TTM)**, the **Estimated Growth Rate** and the **Future P/E Value**. With this method I get a stock price of **$293 per share** which is higher than what it is now. Almost double. That<U+00B4>s why you have to be careful with this analysis. Always do your own due diligence.

**What I<U+00B4>ll do.** I believe in Apple. I think they will stay for a long time and innovate even more. That<U+00B4>s why, although the price is not where I would want it to be, I will continue to **dollar-cost-average**. That way I don<U+00B4>t mind the volatile market and hold for the longterm. Even if they don<U+00B4>t double in 5 years, I<U+00B4>m rather bullish on this company.

*Apple Inc. (AAPL), suffering from a global supply crunch, is now confronting a different problem: slowing demand. The company has told its component suppliers
that demand for the iPhone 13 lineup has weakened, people familiar with the matter said, signaling that some consumers have decided against trying to get the hard-to-
find item, Bloomberg News reports.
Already, Apple had cut its iPhone 13 production goal for this year by as many as 10 million units, down from a target of 90 million, because of a lack of parts, Bloomberg News reported. But the hope was to make up much of that shortfall next year, when supply is expected to improve. The company is now informing its vendors that those orders may not materialize, according to the people, who asked not to be identified because the discussions are private.*

\-AAPL normally trades at 12-22PE during a decade of HIGH growth;

\-AAPL now is expecting to grow at 1-4% YOY and trades 30-60% it's average valuation;

\-Demand has been pulled forward years in advance, and its the kind of demand that is not occurring. You don't buy a new Macbook every year and the Iphone's hardly change at this point;

\-Even the AAPL car at best would bring in 10 Billion by 2026. The market cap is 3 trillion NOW, it's insignificant and laughable;

\-China is imploding with real estate being 25% of GDP they are going into a harsh recession now that Evergrande has defaulted. AAPL sales will likely decline.

\-WSB has presented Wallstreet with a once in a life time opportunity. Wallstreet invests a massive amount of money in AAPL and FAANG since they have huge market caps that allow them to store a vast amount of their wealth into. Wallstreet knows this bull market is coming to an end and now WSB is allowing them to exit their positions into the hands of retail investors.

Fed Rates increase, makes it more expensive to borrow money and develop for businesses like AAPL.

At one point, AAPL was considering developing their own semiconductors, wireless components, etc, that they currently outsource from AVGO.

With the fed increasing rates this year, does that have the potential to further solidify AAPL's dependence on AVGO for another year, making AVGO a good buy at sub $600 right now?

I remember reading a report that around 15 B or 20% of AVGO's business was from supplying AAPL.

But anyway, with the current climate and increasing fed rates this year (which might even be as low as 0.25% so potentially negligible), does it make it reasonable to assume that AAPL may hold off on spending on that semiconductor development for a while, making AVGO a pretty good shot at below $600 entry right now?

Hopefully I'm making sense here.  Completely hypotheticals.

Hey Bull Gang, I hope you all managed to survive last weeks<U+0092> bloodbath. Things are looking extremely grim out there, with many stocks dropping like rocks. We must proceed with extreme caution this week as many earnings reports may get skewed due to the overall movements of the market. If the market is outright dying, it won<U+0092>t matter if a given company put up record profits - it will follow the general movements of the market and drop regardless. Stay safe, and let<U+0092>s get into it!

&amp;nbsp;

#The Spreadsheet
To aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jfBsAVwElwhh5AJSSO8wYUHFLPCNioKBqxF5K_qs1PQ/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn<U+0092>t indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you<U+0092>re struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn<U+0092>t working for you, refer to [this link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jfBsAVwElwhh5AJSSO8wYUHFLPCNioKBqxF5K_qs1PQ/edit?usp=sharing) instead!

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I<U+0092>ve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&amp;nbsp;

- **Almost EVERYTHING is inefficiently priced. Avoid anyways.** If you guys have been following my earnings analysis, you<U+0092>ll know that I<U+0092>m a huge fan of inefficiently priced options relative to their historical moves. This week, because volatility is so cranked, almost EVERYTHING is inefficiently priced to the sell side, meaning that options of all forms are EXTREMELY expensive. Normally this scenario would influence us to sell options such as strangles to collect inflated premiums, and benefit from the IV crush post earnings, however, this week is vastly different. With the market chopping and dying, the $VIX has spiked to over 30, and mega-cap stocks like $MSFT and $AAPL have begun to move like penny stocks. It<U+0092>s extremely rare to see mega-caps swings 3%+ in a given trading day, yet we<U+0092>re seeing that on a regular basis. If we sell options to take advantage of this inflated IV, there<U+0092>s a really high chance we get punished and blown out, resulting in immense losses. Although it may be tempting to sell inefficiently priced options, this is one of the few circumstances I would avoid this type of play. For more information on pricing inefficiencies and short/long vol trades, check out [this article.](https://www.hungrybotalerts.com/blog/pricing-inefficiencies-around-earnings)

&amp;nbsp;

- **Consider Selling the Rips instead of Buying the Dips.** This is just general knowledge, but in choppy or weak markets like these, consider selling any rips that may occur. For example, if $TSLA releases a decent ER, pops AH on Wednesday and opens green on Thursday, there is an extremely high chance it will gives up those gains by EOW. Many big players will be looking to exit positions on pops, meaning if you short into the rip you<U+0092>ll be able to safely ride their coattails. We saw this exact price action last week across all earnings, and with $SOFI releasing their bank charter. $SOFI literally popped 30% and gave up all those gains up before the week even ended. Along a similar vein, don<U+0092>t buy dips. In a healthy market, this strategy is awesome, but in a weak market, the dip will likely continue to dip. Shield your capital at all costs.

&amp;nbsp;

- **Multiple steel companies report this week. Consider running an $SLX collateral trade.** $STLD, $NUE, and $X all report this week, all with extremely high implied moves. Consider running a play on $SLX instead of the individual tickers in order to mitigate your risks and amplify your rewards. $SLX has less than half the IV of the individual tickers meaning the options will be cheaper and the rewards will be greater. Once $STLD reports, most steel companies will mimic that move in an attempt to <U+0093>price in<U+0094> these earnings, thereby moving $SLX an equal amount in the process. For more information on collateral trades, check out [this article.](https://www.hungrybotalerts.com/blog/collateral-plays)

&amp;nbsp;

- **Be wary of the Fed annihilating your plays.** JPow and the gang drop details on the rate hike at 2:00 on Wednesday, and then follow it up with a conference right after. I<U+0092>m not too sure how either will go, but these market moving events will easily overwrite the results of any potential earnings plays you may have made. I would personally avoid making any earnings trades Wednesday night and Thursday morning. If you really need your fix of gambling, consider using significantly reduced position sizes.

&amp;nbsp;

#Summary and Conclusion

Stay safe out there everyone! With volatility high, and options prices even higher, this week will prove to be extremely gnarly. That being said, use the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jfBsAVwElwhh5AJSSO8wYUHFLPCNioKBqxF5K_qs1PQ/edit?usp=sharing) to determine which stocks offer the best risk to reward ratio, and play accordingly!

They make great products and are constantly looking to innovate. If you are an investor I believe you will likely see strong returns over a longer time horizon.

Right now however, AAPL is overvalued in my opinion.

Let's observe the last 4 years of revenue:

* 2018 = $266B
* 2019 = $260B
* 2020 = $275B
* **2021 = $366B**

One of these things is not like the other. As you can see, prior to 2021 we saw relatively stable growth, and then BOOM 33%. On the surface this looks great! But let's get into why this has me worried.

I'm a health insurance actuary and in our world we recognize a phenomenon call a benefit **RUSH-CRUSH-HUSH.** This occurs when there are **plan design changes**. 

**RUSH**

When a new benefit is added, or there is a significant benefit increase beyond what we would typically observe. People **RUSH** to use the new benefits as they get new glasses, get their cavities filled, and get that procedure they've been holding off on in anticipation of the benefit increase.

**CRUSH**

The next year there is nothing to spend money on. Everyone already got their new glasses, teeth are filled, and that procedure they got fixed whatever health issue they had. The inflated spending experience a **CRUSH.**

**HUSH**

2-years after the plan change this volatility will **HUSH.** We will observe that claiming returns to a level that we would typically expect, but since the prior year was a CRUSH, the year-over-year increase appears more severe than expected. This would catch a layman off guard, but a well informed actuary would understand that benefits are simply returning back to a reasonable level.

In the case of AAPL. The plan design change is the pandemic. People weren't spending money on restaurants, bars, travel, concerts, sports, etc. so they had more dollars to allocate to updating their gadgets (**RUSH**). In 2022, people will have already updated their gadgets so there is no need to go out and purchase more. Add to this that the world is expected to reopen, so more dollars will be allocated to other things mentioned above (**CRUSH**). In 2023, I would expect spending to return to a more routine level, some people will update their gadgets while others will hold off another year (HUSH).

Essentially what I'm expecting is that AAPL will have a down year, worse than expected (because of **CRUSH**). This will cause people to over-sell which is where the buying opportunity comes in because in the **HUSH** phase, we know that spending will return to normal. It will appear to be strong growth but in reality it is simply just reverting to the mean.

I read the annual report to look at the components of AAPL's revenue. I would expect that wearables, home, accessories and services continue to grow at a strong pace since those are newer products that are growing organically compared to the iPhone, iPad, and Mac. However, iPhone, iPad and Mac saw a combined 36% YoY increase and they account for 71% of revenue. There is a chance that the market prices all this in but the point of this piece of writing is to inform you that these changes are typically more exaggerated than intuition expects. With a PE of 28.5 the market expects growth, and if AAPL instead sees a reduction in revenue the market will overreact, this is when the buying opportunity arises and you ride the HUSH to glory!
