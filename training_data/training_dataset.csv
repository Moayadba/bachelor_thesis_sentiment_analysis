l29u6e,"A detailed breakdown of the GME Shitron video with answers.: SOME of what he said was technically accurate...but those things can be countered with little effort.







1. There is no short squeeze and shares are cheap to borrow!







Really?  Then why is there still negative float?  Why the bombardment of negative media coverage, including your tweet timed just as momentum was trending towards the $50 mark Tuesday? Why the flood of brand new user accounts on financial social media sites relentlessly bashing the stock? And a borrow rate of 30%? Doesn't seem very fucking cheap to me.







2. Numbers don't lie, people lie.







Yes fuck taco, you've lied many times to create a panic scenario in order to make money off of put options...thank you for pointing that out.  I'm sure the SEC will be bending you over eventually this year....AGAIN.







Sales being down for console launch was a result of two primary things: bot purchases sucking inventory availability, and the fact that 75% of the malls across the country were at required limited capacities with less average traffic than 20 fucking years ago due to covid.  Hard to sell things out of a store that can't be open.







3. Valuation matters.  







Yes it does.  All future projected earnings were based off of the EXISTING antiquated business model.  It is fairly clear at this point after Cohen's letter to the board in November that the company will no longer be following this business model AT ALL. While we don't have the particulars of the plan yet, we do know that Cohen, his COO, CFO, CMO built an e-commerce from scratch with a little over 100 million funding and turned it in to a business  that within four years had a 20x revenue multiple and made Jeff fucking Bezos back down from competing aggressively against it.







4. Know who's on the other side of the trade.







Here he implies that all the people buying the stock are dipshits that deliver his fat ass Pizza, while the douchebags running Melvin Capital are the smartest guys around.  What he fails to acknowledge is that individually we might be dumb as rocks, collectively we have unending resources for due diligence, and by now have clearly laid out the underlying true value potential far better then the hedgies who's due diligence has amounted to ""short into oblivion cuz it's Blockbuster 2.0, end of story."" not acknowledging the fact that there's greater odds they've just been complacent thinking that no one would notice they over leveraged themselves on what they just assumed was a sure bet.  He also implies that Ryan Cohen would just take the money and run as if this was a fucking swing trade for him.  It's not only an insult to his intent and vision, but it's an insult to our faith in his character.







5. Your company can become your biggest enemy ie. an offering to raise cash and dilute stock value.







You think we give a fuck if they throw out an at the market shelf offer when this hits $300 after we bankrupt fuckers like you?  The diamond hands in this legion are not going to get salty if they lose a quarter or half of their profits after being up 500%.  It is something that they should actually do...but if they've paid attention at all to what's going on (how could they not?) they know that we're on the precipice of a uncontrollable skyrocket of share price that they can take advantage of.  You think they're going to settle for $40? Think again dipshit.  SIDE NOTE: please don't buy at 300 okay retards?

Before the massive short dump, the biggest gamma position yesterday was the $800 strike call option expiring Friday, up from the $100 strike as of Monday, which is partly why I thought the low yesterday would be $300, I thought we were well on the way to a gamma squeeze the likes of which would dwarf the January move.

mgujym,"What does accelerating GME to digital mean?: I'm curious what folks who are long GME think happens when Gamestop accelerates and goes 100% digital? Why do you think that is good for Gamestop? I have no position in Gamestop, either long or short. I'm just watching it all with fascination. I used to work at Activision Blizzard, where their big game is Call of Duty. You know how much money Gamestop makes on a digital download of COD? Zero. Not even 1 penny. Activision has to pay Sony a 30% platform fee, for the privilege of selling Call of Duty on the Playstation store. Because Sony made the hardware, and got all the customers to buy the hardware, video game publishers have to pay a platform fee in order to publish their video game onto their digital store, ie, the Playstation store on the PS4 or PS5. Same with Microsoft. Activision, and other video game publishers, have to also pay a 30% platform fee to MSFT for users to digitally download their game. Gamestop gets zero from that digital download, either with Sony or MSFT. So, if Ryan Cohen is able to digitally transform GME into a digital powerhouse, and let's say all video games go digital, GME will make nothing from digitally downloaded games. Gamestop makes money from selling physical games, hardware consoles, game controllers, accessories, maybe some funko pops, buying and selling used physical games. But on a digital download...they don't make any money from that. Back at the end of 2019, GME management pitched Activision, and they wanted a slice of our digital download revenues. They explained it as, ""Look, we have millions of customers, we have their data, we know their address and emails...we can leverage that to help Activision make more money. So...we want a slice of your digital download business."" When my team heard about this, (we were in a conference room, waiting for a meeting to start), first, we all started laughing. After about 5 minutes of laughing and making jokes, we got serious. Why would we give any our of revenues to GME? We don't need to do that. They weren't clear on how they could leverage the customer data to our benefit. Someone made a good point: would GME give us a slice of their used physical game business? Because that is huge margins for GME. They buy your used physical game for like $5 or $10, and put it on the shelf as a used game for like $20 or $25. Great margins! Would they give us a piece of their used game business? No way. They don't need Activision to do their used game business, why should they give us any of that revenue? Same for digital. We don't need GME to sell digitally, and, we already pay a 30% platform fee to Sony and MSFT, why would we give GME a piece of the digital rev? So, I don't understand how Cohen will transform GME. If you agree that physical games are going away, and digital and streaming is the future...then GME is a dinosaur. I don't see it succeeding, but I could be wrong. Think of this. GME just posted their 9th straight declining quarter of revenues. In a COVID year where people are home, you have their undivided attention, AND new hardware launch of PS5 and new XBOX, they still posted declining rev. When new consoles come out, once every 8 years or so, you should be posting huge revenue increases, not decreases. They still went down in rev. This upcoming Xmas, with no new hardware launch that I'm aware of, I can't see their rev's going up. What am I missing?","What does accelerating GME to digital mean?: I'm curious what folks who are long GME think happens when Gamestop accelerates and goes 100% digital? Why do you think that is good for Gamestop? I have no position in Gamestop, either long or short. I'm just watching it all with fascination. I used to work at Activision Blizzard, where their big game is Call of Duty. You know how much money Gamestop makes on a digital download of COD? Zero. Not even 1 penny. Activision has to pay Sony a 30% platform fee, for the privilege of selling Call of Duty on the Playstation store. Because Sony made the hardware, and got all the customers to buy the hardware, video game publishers have to pay a platform fee in order to publish their video game onto their digital store, ie, the Playstation store on the PS4 or PS5. Same with Microsoft. Activision, and other video game publishers, have to also pay a 30% platform fee to MSFT for users to digitally download their game. Gamestop gets zero from that digital download, either with Sony or MSFT. So, if Ryan Cohen is able to digitally transform GME into a digital powerhouse, and let's say all video games go digital, GME will make nothing from digitally downloaded games. Gamestop makes money from selling physical games, hardware consoles, game controllers, accessories, maybe some funko pops, buying and selling used physical games. But on a digital download...they don't make any money from that. Back at the end of 2019, GME management pitched Activision, and they wanted a slice of our digital download revenues.

l2vrdf,"Hold 100% of your GME NOW for a dozen of reasons: I'm gonna try to make this quick, TL;DR: it's absolutely crucial you hold ALL your shares now and into the weekend.







- If you believe in astrology aka patterns, [THIS](https://imgur.com/a/sNUBmp0) was GMEs pattern on the 13th of january. You know how it went from there. So absolutely hold everything into the weekend, even if it dips EOD. Mondays are usually greener for GME than other days anyways, with shorties getting to think long and hard over the weekend probably even more so. GME tended to repeat patterns a lot over the last few months, with just the percentage moves getting more extreme each time.







- Don't get cute with trying to exit and reenter on spikes. I admit to doing so and even sometimes daytrading GME the last few weeks to months. This worked well for a certain time where it consistently spiked in the AM and sold off (or got shorted) through the day. Now is not the time to do that anymore, for two reasons:    



1. you will burn yourself, if you just look at yesterdays graph, the shenanigans are going off so hard, it's basically impossible to time or predict anything. You're just risking on losing potential gains.    



2. You hurt the short squeeze by giving shorties potential to sell out of their positions slowly, even it's just small amounts. The harder you hold, the stronger the upwards pressure gets.







- For the especially endangered retards out there:    



No, the squeeze has not yet squoze, this is merely the beginning

- If you believe in astrology aka patterns, [THIS](https://imgur.com/a/sNUBmp0) was GMEs pattern on the 13th of january. You know how it went from there. So absolutely hold everything into the weekend, even if it dips EOD. Mondays are usually greener for GME than other days anyways, with shorties getting to think long and hard over the weekend probably even more so. GME tended to repeat patterns a lot over the last few months, with just the percentage moves getting more extreme each time.







- Don't get cute with trying to exit and reenter on spikes. I admit to doing so and even sometimes daytrading GME the last few weeks to months. This worked well for a certain time where it consistently spiked in the AM and sold off (or got shorted) through the day. Now is not the time to do that anymore, for two reasons:    



1. you will burn yourself, if you just look at yesterdays graph, the shenanigans are going off so hard, it's basically impossible to time or predict anything. You're just risking on losing potential gains.    



2. You hurt the short squeeze by giving shorties potential to sell out of their positions slowly, even it's just small amounts. The harder you hold, the stronger the upwards pressure gets.







- For the especially endangered retards out there:    



No, the squeeze has not yet squoze, this is merely the beginning

**Round 2**: Ding, ding, ding. Here's my previous [analysis](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lspbb5/gme_dd_analysis_of_options_expiry_on_226_and/)







---







**TL;DR**: The data indicates that squeezes could be on the way.







---



**Analysis**







Currently: Roughly $227m in value, or 11.6m shares, (call-put) are in the money. 







* At each $10 threshold up to $150/share, approximately 1m shares come into the money at each increment. 



* At $160/share, approximately 2m shares come into the money.







&amp;nbsp;







Since rate of delta change is the highest around each strike price (meaning gamma is also largest). It would lead me to believe that a ton of shares will need to be bought to hedge these positions as these share price amounts are passed (creating a sequence of gamma squeezes).







&amp;nbsp;







**If price were to squeeze up to $810/share (~56b market cap): 







* The net calls in the money would exceed the float.** This is insane! Even if calls were covered on the way up by buying the underlying, it's not possible to cover more than 100% of float



* 8m shares would come into the money creating a huge gamma squeeze



* This in turn would create a massive short squeeze (even if current short reporting is accurate, which is somewhat questionable at this point, there are more net calls alone that need to be covered to exceed float, which means shorts would be squeezed not just because of the price, but also because of share lenders calling shares. P.S. - Not sure how this works, so would like to hear others weigh-in if they understand this better)



* Really, hitting this price seems like it would create a squeeze of epic proportions







&amp;nbsp;







As of 3/3 close: (Call Value ITM - Put Value ITM) = **&gt;$226m** | Call Shares ITM - Put Shares ITM = **&gt;11.5m**

**Round 2**: Ding, ding, ding. Here's my previous [analysis](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lspbb5/gme_dd_analysis_of_options_expiry_on_226_and/)







---







**TL;DR**: The data indicates that squeezes could be on the way.







---



**Analysis**







Currently: Roughly $227m in value, or 11.6m shares, (call-put) are in the money. 







* At each $10 threshold up to $150/share, approximately 1m shares come into the money at each increment. 



* At $160/share, approximately 2m shares come into the money.







&amp;nbsp;







Since rate of delta change is the highest around each strike price (meaning gamma is also largest). It would lead me to believe that a ton of shares will need to be bought to hedge these positions as these share price amounts are passed (creating a sequence of gamma squeezes).







&amp;nbsp;







**If price were to squeeze up to $810/share (~56b market cap): 







* The net calls in the money would exceed the float.** This is insane! Even if calls were covered on the way up by buying the underlying, it's not possible to cover more than 100% of float



* 8m shares would come into the money creating a huge gamma squeeze



* This in turn would create a massive short squeeze (even if current short reporting is accurate, which is somewhat questionable at this point, there are more net calls alone that need to be covered to exceed float, which means shorts would be squeezed not just because of the price, but also because of share lenders calling shares. P.S. - Not sure how this works, so would like to hear others weigh-in if they understand this better)



* Really, hitting this price seems like it would create a squeeze of epic proportions







&amp;nbsp;







As of 3/3 close: (Call Value ITM - Put Value ITM) = **&gt;$226m** | Call Shares ITM - Put Shares ITM = **&gt;11.5m**

1)The stock was OVERSHORTED more than 120%



2)There was a LOT OF DEMAND around the world

1)Plain and simple Wall Street STOLE FROM ALL OF US



2)Wall street ILLEGALLY restricted DEMAND but allowed for unlimited supply to continue causing the price to dip a lot

4) Wall Street gave time to HF to lower GME shorts to drop the price and cover



5) GME is now shorted about 88% or even less after dropping to $50-60



6) Wall Street manipulating the price to cause Retail fear of SELLING



7)Pulling every dirty tactic, using the media and STOPPING the momentum worldwide to BUY GME

          8. And last but not least, even if they can turn around and make 500 million profit a year, that still does NOT justify their valuation!!!!



          9. The PS5 and the standard XBOX dont even have a disk drive no more. What is Gamestop going to sell in their stores from now on, WSB merch??!",NEGATIVE

Here<U+0092>s why I think so.







Clovis Oncology Inc is currently one of the most shorted stock currently on the Daq at the moment.







1. It currently has a days to cover of ~6.77 which  for those of you who don<U+0092>t know, means if they were to rebuy their positions, it would take 7 days of average trading volume. I<U+0092>m fairly sure $GME is between 3-4 so covering this short position could prove to be difficult for shorters.







2. It has a percentage of float shorted at 42%, this is far lower then $GME<U+0092>s of ~110%-130% not too sure of current figures but still a massive opportunity. In comparison, $BB has a meagre 7.15% of float shorted, and $NOK has 0.9%. The potential for a large short squeeze for $CLVS absolutely shits on them in my opinion.

4. It opened at $6.80 yesterday and closed at $7.90, a 16% increase. Premarket, it<U+0092>s at $8.12 as of writing.







5. This stock looks locked and loaded to rally HARD. Any spike in demand will enact call options on shorts and cause a nice short squeeze.







6. Lastly, if this gains ANY traction WHATSOEVER on WSB, I definitely see this turning into the next $GME, except this time the train hasn<U+0092>t even left the station yet IMO.







P.S. I hadn<U+0092>t had a lot of knowledge until I spent a while research indicators of short squeezes the last few days (a lot of research), and this is in my opinion the best short squeeze option currently on the market. Please correct me if you think I have said something untrue. 







I cannot claim this solely as my own tip, I had this company as a potential option to go long but credit goes to Norok on trading view, he spotted this potential far before anyone else I have seen: here is the link to his really informative YouTube video:

Here's why I think so.







Clovis Oncology Inc is currently one of the most shorted stock currently on the Daq at the moment.







1. It currently has a days to cover of ~6.77 which  for those of you who don't know, means if they were to rebuy their positions, it would take 7 days of average trading volume. I'm fairly sure $GME is between 3-4 so covering this short position could prove to be difficult for shorters.

The behaviour of an infinite short squeeze (ISS) are violent.  In financial history, the two widely cited cases are the VW infinite squeeze of '08 and the Blue Appron one of '20.

When shares can't be covered and stock price increases, shorts are forced to cover by Market Makers.  But because of the huge supply/demand imbalance, shorts have to cover at prices that would seem irrational on a cursory glance but are rational based on the supply/demand equilibrium of available shares.  ***Consequently, it is normal to see 1000% increases in one day.

First of all, *you don't buy stocks to fuck other people*.







**You buy stocks to make fucking money.** Believe me - the market is a giant casino and will give you and everyone else a giant **fucking ass-raping** at times.







A lot of people believe that *their absolutely minuscule combined money of 9 million people* will ""**fuck Wall Street hedge funds**.""







**Well, it won't**. You want to know why????







I'll fucking tell you. Because the *short squeeze was Wall Street cannibals feeding on each other.*

Like protesting. Voting. Fucking running for fucking office.  Calling your fucking Senator or Congressman and saying, ""motherfucker quit raping me in the fucking ass!!!""







And maybe those aren't actual ways to fight it. But they're **wicked fucking more likely** to make a difference **than** **throwing your money away on bad investments**.

pwm5vb,"Why I<U+0092>m Expecting a Big Week for GME: ### TLDR:







Simplex Trading LLC is the last remaining financial entity listed in the Bloomberg Terminal<U+0092>s list of PUTs for GME maintaining a file date for their positions of **3/31/2021**.  They also hold the largest number of PUTs (80,702 contracts), twice as many as second in line Susquehanna, and are the highest percentage out (10.550%) among those listed.  All other PUTs have since been re-filed on **6/30/2021**.







I believe these dates indicate historical Collateralized Loan Obligation (CLO) activity associated with GameStop and provide an indication of what to expect as we move towards **9/30/2021** and onward.







### Background







In January, February 2021 $126.6 billion of loans were said to have been repriced ([S&amp;P Global - March 12th, 2021](https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/quick-take-us-clo-refinancing-and-reset-activity-surges-63108875)).







Archegos was liquidated between March 12th and March 26th, 2021 ([Credit Suisse - July 29th, 2021](https://www.credit-suisse.com/media/assets/corporate/docs/about-us/investor-relations/financial-disclosures/results/csg-special-committee-bod-report-archegos.pdf)).  It<U+0092>s been said that the firm turned **$10 billion into an estimated $100 billion** worth of assets ([Bloomberg - April 3rd, 2021](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-04-03/the-number-of-the-week-is-100-billion)). 







&amp;amp;amp;gt; <U+0093>Typically, for new-issue transactions, the CLO debt tranches are collectively 10 times the size of the notional amount of the equity interest.<U+0094> - https://www.stout.com/en/insights/article/primer-valuation-clo-equity-financial-reporting







On March 26th, 2021 the Fed reported a daily Reverse Repurchase amount of $11.4 billion.  By March 31st, the daily Reverse Repurchase amount skyrocketed up to $134 billion.  An increase of $124.297 billion. ([St. Louis Federal Reserve - RRP Chart](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/)).  This was notable because the Fed<U+0092>s RRP activity had been effectively dormant until this uptick.







### Hypothesis







As evidenced by the volume of CLO repricing in Jan/Feb, the end date of the Archegos liquidation, proportion of equity compared to total Archegos assets and uptick in RRPs on March 31st, 2021 my reading leads me to believe that Archegos was more of a CLO Manager than Family Office and that some of their positions (illiquid investments in junk-grade CLOs) were auctioned off and then repriced to SOFR at the end of March 2021.







Historically CLOs were priced off 3-month LIBOR but, out of concern the benchmark was being manipulated by financial institutions, the Federal Reserve is in the process of transitioning CLOs to their own rate called SOFR that is based on the daily RRP amounts ([Bloomberg - July 8th, 2021](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-08/growing-clo-market-has-a-libor-transition-problem-on-horizon)).







9/30/2021 is 3 days away and represents the 2nd-ever quarterly refinancing of CLOs after the formal recommendation of SOFR was made by the Alternative Reference Rates Committee ([AARC](https://www.newyorkfed.org/arrc)) on July 29th, 2021.







There is a process called <U+0093>Warehousing<U+0094> in the CLO world where <U+0093>CLO Managers purchase initial collateral before the closing date<U+0094> which typically lasts 3-6 months ([Pinebridge - September 19th, 2019](https://www.pinebridge.com/en/insights/clo-beyond-the-complexity)).







**9/30/2021 represents the 6-month mark since Simplex filed their 80,702 PUT contracts**.







GME close on 3/31/2021: $189.82







GME close on 6/30/2021: $214.14







GME close on 9/30/2021: ???







### Conclusion







While many of my posts have historically shied away from dates I believe the evidence here is too clear and strong to avoid mention.  Worth noting 9/30/2021 is just *a* date and, given the fact the average tenor of Archegos<U+0092> contracts was 24 months, there could be many other interesting ones as well.

my first brilliant move was selling everything in the opener at 82$ because everything seemed to crash. after that i bought back in at 92. sold at 100 for a profit. bought back in at 110 because it seemed to recover again. sold 2500<U+0080> worth of nvidia shares to inject into 20 gme shares @ 150. then it all went down and i sold at 107.

Lots of big players exited their positions already and probably aren't looking to buy back in anytime soon.

The point I have to make is, anyone still in Gamestop, why? You could be making so much more money elsewhere. Those who saw the signs and moved to weed stocks made a bundle. Now, granted most were in before the latest weed run up, but the momentum traders among you still made a good bit of coin. Obviously the weed craze won't last forever, but if you momentum trade like the majority of the group here, you'd be in and out with profit. 







The long and short of it is, your money could be better spent elsewhere, even if elsewhere is on YOLOs for options that are far OTM. 







The original theory on Gamestop may have been moving in the right direction, but where are we now? We're at a stock that's pretty low volume, trading pretty flat, or downward depending on your perspective, on the way to a sub billion dollar market cap.

l0j7q9,"Stock Market News for Today | Stimulus Bill | TSLA, NKLA, GME &amp; other Stock Market News [01-19]: **Biden unveils the $1.9T stimulus package proposal. Tesla starts deliveries of the Model Y in China. Lemonade drops after the latest Citron short opinion while Nikola &amp; GameStop shareholders jump ship. Let<U+0092>s talk about this and other stock market news**







Hello everyone and Good Morning! So, let<U+0092>s start with the recap of the last few days as I haven<U+0092>t made a post since Wednesday, as I was busy making a full stock analysis on Amazon which you can check by clicking [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kxurg0/amazon_stock_150_upside_amazon_stock_price_target/).







So, on Thursday we saw all 3 major indexes finish in the red, with the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/MPQ6PVW) losing .12%, the [DOW](https://ibb.co/GJf3qV9) dropping almost 70 points and the broad stock market [SP500](https://ibb.co/r51hS22) dropping below $3800 to finish the day, as the [VIX](https://ibb.co/sq1P6gm) rose again by almost 5%, though 70% of the companies were [advancing](https://ibb.co/yhsdpZD) on normal volumes with just 8 new lows, as 4 of the 11 [sectors](https://ibb.co/ZW0k1VD) finished in the green with Energy outperforming by quite some gap, while Technology was the biggest loser, as Large-Cap Growth companies were the [underperformers](https://ibb.co/jZW53gf), while small-caps shined, with all 3 segments gaining more than 2% for the day.







Here is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/hsmYfRz) from Thursday, with Amazon, Microsoft, Tesla, Netflix &amp; Facebook all losing more than 1%, while the biggest gainers were the Semiconductors, Alibaba and some companies from the Materials and Oil &amp; Gas Industry.







We also received the investor sentiment [survey](https://ibb.co/XZNYQHY), which for me came in better with a drop of almost 1% in bullish investors and 4% in neutral ones, as fear has reached almost 5% more investors in this past week, which is a good sign for opportunities in the stock market.







Meanwhile, Friday was even worse for the broad stock market, with the [SP500](https://ibb.co/Ms5m47G) losing .72% as the [DOW](https://ibb.co/dKc4ZV0) dropped 177 points while the tech heavy [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/MkcyrQV) was the biggest underperformer dropping below $13000, as the [VIX](https://ibb.co/RSGmvvN) continued to rise near the 25 level and even had a spike near the 26 level in the early morning, but overall finished the [week](https://ibb.co/SnvsgHc) down almost 3%.







We saw again 4 of the 11 [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/0GTqNZG) finish in the green, but this time Energy was the biggest underperformer, losing almost 4% and giving up some of the huge gains made up this week, while Real Estate was the only sector to post a gain of more than 1% and Communications continued to recover after a bad start to the week, as almost 70% of the companies were declining on [Friday](https://ibb.co/grwfwwM), with Large-Cap Growth Companies slightly recovering to finish the [week](https://ibb.co/vX2mxss) down only 1.2%







Here is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/GdWj575) from Friday, in which you can struggle to find some bright spots, with the gains being concentrated in the Health Care &amp; Real Estate sectors, while for the [WEEK](https://ibb.co/441kLYw), there is some more breadth with Energy, Banks and Semiconductors also posting some gains.







On Thursday we also saw [Powell](https://ibb.co/M7vznm4) reiterating the point that rates won<U+0092>t be raised unless inflation becomes a serious problem, as he believes there is still plenty of room in the labor markets until maximum employment is reached, with this point being sustained by the increase in initial jobless [CLAIMS](https://ibb.co/X5brzGZ) which jumped almost 200K, a lot worse than expected and the previous month, as continuing jobless claims also jumped by about the same to 5.27M, a big increase over last week.







Moving on, Friday we also received more economic data, with the January [Consumer](https://ibb.co/n38hy4w) sentiment coming in at 79.2 lower than expected and the previous read, as consumers have lost confidence both in the current conditions and in expectations.







We also saw the New York business [activity](https://ibb.co/92Rydt9) coming in at 3.5, worse than the 6 expected and the 4.9 in the previous month, with new orders seeing an increase but being offset by a huge drop in shipments.







Business [Inventories](https://ibb.co/TRs2SMW) came in as expected at a .5% increase M/M, while Producer [prices](https://ibb.co/py4bpTn) rose less than expected and retail [sales](https://ibb.co/X2v2Y0Z) fell more than expected with a .7% decrease M/M.







This [WEEK](https://ibb.co/VqGMnJT) we start of slow, with no big data coming in until Thursday as we await the Biden inauguration tomorrow while the most interesting [earnings](https://ibb.co/B2T64dc) for me are Goldman Sachs as a continued read on how the banks are doing after last weeks good numbers, Netflix to see how the stay-at-home stocks will continue to perform and Intel to see how they manage to turn around things.







In some other stock market news, we saw [Aphria](https://ibb.co/nwxNpm0) beat consensus in earnings and starting a broad rally in pot stocks, while [Lemonade](https://ibb.co/vw4dXQ7) dropped more than 9% after CITRON went at them again, implying a drop back to under 100$ expected very soon.







We also saw IPOs soar again in the first trading day, with [PETCO](https://ibb.co/KwTHrvY) popping almost 50% and [POSHMARK](https://ibb.co/3cGk45W) more than doubling before dropping 20% as this IPOs are way overbought on every single launch just like most of the SPACs, with [Churchill](https://ibb.co/6JGGKHP) Capital also climbing huge on reports of a Lucid Motors deal, but this is only speculation and could have massive downside if the deal doesn<U+0092>t go through.







Meanwhile, [Delta](https://ibb.co/FzGKp9C) Airlines reported Q4 earnings and hinted at a positive cash flow by late-spring or summer as they reduced the cash burn from $24M to $12M/ day in Q4, which helped most of the airlines rally.







Thursday was capped off my [Biden's](https://ibb.co/bzh0fsV) new relief package proposal that seems to be around $1.9T. This will serve probably as a start point of future negotiations. This package includes $400B in crisis aids including $20B for vaccines, $50B for testing, $30B for supplies and $140B targeted at helping schools reopen and stay open.







The plan also includes $1T in aids to individuals including $1400 stimulus checks and extending the unemployment benefits to $400/week through September, $30B in rental assistance and extending the federal moratorium on evictions and foreclosure through September and increasing the minimum wage to $15/hour.







Biden<U+0092>s propsal also includes the highly debated help for state &amp; local governments worth $350B &amp; $50B in small business grants and loans. 







This will probably serve as a starting point and I don<U+0092>t expect everything to pass even with the blue sweep. It<U+0092>s likely going to be less than $1.9T, and most of the debate will continue to happen on the state &amp; local help and is also likely to exclude things like increasing the minimum hourly wage, as this is not something temporary like most of the other costs and is likely to receive big roadblocks. This will likely be a short-term boost for the stock market, but the impacts of this in terms of inflation, debt and other economic factors are still unknown in the long-run.







And moving on, Friday we saw [Tesla's](https://ibb.co/Vqmf9Mm) forecasted deliveries increased to 1M cars by Wedbush who also raised their price target to $950 with a bull case of $1250, as the Tesla [Model Y](https://ibb.co/1Qws23d) has finally started deliveries in China and will be one of the biggest bets Tesla has made, as the affordable SUV demand is much higher than any of the other Tesla models, while in contrast [Nikola](https://ibb.co/r3dFQSk) seems to be having firms jumping board with an early investor recently selling over 7M shares. Some similar action was seen from the director of [GameStop](https://ibb.co/rvyQdvq) who sold 800K shares after the recent pop in the stock. This kind of companies provide high risk/high reward opportunities, but you should have a tight approach to them, you should take profits whenever you can and not risk losing your gains on these highly volatile stocks that don<U+0092>t have a good fundamental basis.







So, let<U+0092>s hope for a good day in the markets as the [WORLD](https://ibb.co/nr2Pw5W) markets seem to be pointing to a good day, as we await Biden<U+0092>s pick Janet Yellen<U+0092>s [remarks](https://ibb.co/bsjzK1b) on the proposed stimulus and the dollar while the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/S3cfpZq) are also pointing to a green open, with the Nasdaq leading the way.

So, on Thursday we saw all 3 major indexes finish in the red, with the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/MPQ6PVW) losing .12%, the [DOW](https://ibb.co/GJf3qV9) dropping almost 70 points and the broad stock market [SP500](https://ibb.co/r51hS22) dropping below $3800 to finish the day, as the [VIX](https://ibb.co/sq1P6gm) rose again by almost 5%, though 70% of the companies were [advancing](https://ibb.co/yhsdpZD) on normal volumes with just 8 new lows, as 4 of the 11 [sectors](https://ibb.co/ZW0k1VD) finished in the green with Energy outperforming by quite some gap, while Technology was the biggest loser, as Large-Cap Growth companies were the [underperformers](https://ibb.co/jZW53gf), while small-caps shined, with all 3 segments gaining more than 2% for the day.







Here is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/hsmYfRz) from Thursday, with Amazon, Microsoft, Tesla, Netflix &amp; Facebook all losing more than 1%, while the biggest gainers were the Semiconductors, Alibaba and some companies from the Materials and Oil &amp; Gas Industry.







We also received the investor sentiment [survey](https://ibb.co/XZNYQHY), which for me came in better with a drop of almost 1% in bullish investors and 4% in neutral ones, as fear has reached almost 5% more investors in this past week, which is a good sign for opportunities in the stock market.







Meanwhile, Friday was even worse for the broad stock market, with the [SP500](https://ibb.co/Ms5m47G) losing .72% as the [DOW](https://ibb.co/dKc4ZV0) dropped 177 points while the tech heavy [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/MkcyrQV) was the biggest underperformer dropping below $13000, as the [VIX](https://ibb.co/RSGmvvN) continued to rise near the 25 level and even had a spike near the 26 level in the early morning, but overall finished the [week](https://ibb.co/SnvsgHc) down almost 3%.







We saw again 4 of the 11 [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/0GTqNZG) finish in the green, but this time Energy was the biggest underperformer, losing almost 4% and giving up some of the huge gains made up this week, while Real Estate was the only sector to post a gain of more than 1% and Communications continued to recover after a bad start to the week, as almost 70% of the companies were declining on [Friday](https://ibb.co/grwfwwM), with Large-Cap Growth Companies slightly recovering to finish the [week](https://ibb.co/vX2mxss) down only 1.2%







Here is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/GdWj575) from Friday, in which you can struggle to find some bright spots, with the gains being concentrated in the Health Care &amp; Real Estate sectors, while for the [WEEK](https://ibb.co/441kLYw), there is some more breadth with Energy, Banks and Semiconductors also posting some gains.







On Thursday we also saw [Powell](https://ibb.co/M7vznm4) reiterating the point that rates won't be raised unless inflation becomes a serious problem, as he believes there is still plenty of room in the labor markets until maximum employment is reached, with this point being sustained by the increase in initial jobless [CLAIMS](https://ibb.co/X5brzGZ) which jumped almost 200K, a lot worse than expected and the previous month, as continuing jobless claims also jumped by about the same to 5.27M, a big increase over last week.







Moving on, Friday we also received more economic data, with the January [Consumer](https://ibb.co/n38hy4w) sentiment coming in at 79.2 lower than expected and the previous read, as consumers have lost confidence both in the current conditions and in expectations.







We also saw the New York business [activity](https://ibb.co/92Rydt9) coming in at 3.5, worse than the 6 expected and the 4.9 in the previous month, with new orders seeing an increase but being offset by a huge drop in shipments.







Business [Inventories](https://ibb.co/TRs2SMW) came in as expected at a .5% increase M/M, while Producer [prices](https://ibb.co/py4bpTn) rose less than expected and retail [sales](https://ibb.co/X2v2Y0Z) fell more than expected with a .7% decrease M/M.







This [WEEK](https://ibb.co/VqGMnJT) we start of slow, with no big data coming in until Thursday as we await the Biden inauguration tomorrow while the most interesting [earnings](https://ibb.co/B2T64dc) for me are Goldman Sachs as a continued read on how the banks are doing after last weeks good numbers, Netflix to see how the stay-at-home stocks will continue to perform and Intel to see how they manage to turn around things.







In some other stock market news, we saw [Aphria](https://ibb.co/nwxNpm0) beat consensus in earnings and starting a broad rally in pot stocks, while [Lemonade](https://ibb.co/vw4dXQ7) dropped more than 9% after CITRON went at them again, implying a drop back to under 100$ expected very soon.







We also saw IPOs soar again in the first trading day, with [PETCO](https://ibb.co/KwTHrvY) popping almost 50% and [POSHMARK](https://ibb.co/3cGk45W) more than doubling before dropping 20% as this IPOs are way overbought on every single launch just like most of the SPACs, with [Churchill](https://ibb.co/6JGGKHP) Capital also climbing huge on reports of a Lucid Motors deal, but this is only speculation and could have massive downside if the deal doesn't go through.







Meanwhile, [Delta](https://ibb.co/FzGKp9C) Airlines reported Q4 earnings and hinted at a positive cash flow by late-spring or summer as they reduced the cash burn from $24M to $12M/ day in Q4, which helped most of the airlines rally.







Thursday was capped off my [Biden's](https://ibb.co/bzh0fsV) new relief package proposal that seems to be around $1.9T. This will serve probably as a start point of future negotiations. This package includes $400B in crisis aids including $20B for vaccines, $50B for testing, $30B for supplies and $140B targeted at helping schools reopen and stay open.







The plan also includes $1T in aids to individuals including $1400 stimulus checks and extending the unemployment benefits to $400/week through September, $30B in rental assistance and extending the federal moratorium on evictions and foreclosure through September and increasing the minimum wage to $15/hour.







Biden's propsal also includes the highly debated help for state &amp; local governments worth $350B &amp; $50B in small business grants and loans. 







This will probably serve as a starting point and I don't expect everything to pass even with the blue sweep. It's likely going to be less than $1.9T, and most of the debate will continue to happen on the state &amp; local help and is also likely to exclude things like increasing the minimum hourly wage, as this is not something temporary like most of the other costs and is likely to receive big roadblocks. This will likely be a short-term boost for the stock market, but the impacts of this in terms of inflation, debt and other economic factors are still unknown in the long-run.







And moving on, Friday we saw [Tesla's](https://ibb.co/Vqmf9Mm) forecasted deliveries increased to 1M cars by Wedbush who also raised their price target to $950 with a bull case of $1250, as the Tesla [Model Y](https://ibb.co/1Qws23d) has finally started deliveries in China and will be one of the biggest bets Tesla has made, as the affordable SUV demand is much higher than any of the other Tesla models, while in contrast [Nikola](https://ibb.co/r3dFQSk) seems to be having firms jumping board with an early investor recently selling over 7M shares. Some similar action was seen from the director of [GameStop](https://ibb.co/rvyQdvq) who sold 800K shares after the recent pop in the stock. This kind of companies provide high risk/high reward opportunities, but you should have a tight approach to them, you should take profits whenever you can and not risk losing your gains on these highly volatile stocks that don't have a good fundamental basis.







So, let's hope for a good day in the markets as the [WORLD](https://ibb.co/nr2Pw5W) markets seem to be pointing to a good day, as we await Biden's pick Janet Yellen's [remarks](https://ibb.co/bsjzK1b) on the proposed stimulus and the dollar while the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/S3cfpZq) are also pointing to a green open, with the Nasdaq leading the way.

Keep HODLing your asses off.  







1.  Buy any dips.  They will have to buy shares back when their bullshit gets called.  DTCC will step in to liquidate and insure losses if they can't.



2.  WE own the float (synthetic, borrowed) shares.  They will have to buy them back.



3.  Only buy what you can afford to lose.  This is not financial advise.







We have come together for one common cause, to bring fairness and equality to the financial markets.







Tired of hedge fucks having all the power to bankrupt American companies just to turn around and rally around the idea of creating jobs.







APES HodL for your families and hodl for those that don't have many shares.  We are going to Moon !!! Soon!!!  







More Apes joining the movement every minute amd non of us are selling shit until we see 500k!!! 







There really is not a floor if we continue to buy the dips and HODL our Ape asses off.  







Do not let media FUD you into selling at any point.  They will try.  Many of them are funded by the same organizations that short American companies to put them out of business.

**About You All:**



That being said (enough about MY autism), it's become super apparent lately that some of us are transitioning from being a bunch of disorganized toddlers running around with fistfuls of Uncle Sam's placate-the-masses cash, bouncing off each other and losing that cash in a dirty hole in the ground... toward something greater: The Great Autistic Hivemind.

**About Short Squeezes:**



GME and BB (among others) are showing and have shown that when we band together and force an over-shorted stock repeatedly above the shortsellers positions, we can force a short squeeze - be it all at once or slow and steady - while the shortsellers hemorrhage money to interest rates, we are absolutely the market makers when we do this.







Seeing some stonks spike and tank from the short squeeze phenomenon while others like TSLA spike and just hang out, then spike again and again, never to return to some arbitrary <U+0001F308><U+0001F43B> ""fair value"" bullshit....







**Why does this happen?**







Because early iNvEsToRs of stonks like TSLA (which originally attracted basement dweller computer nerds and shit to yolo their shitty 19-to-23-year-old-life-savings on an $0.83 stock) actually believe in something: going to Mars in a self-driving car or some shit. I don't know, I missed the boat.







Each time a short squeeze happens on Papa Elon's computercar company, there is no massive selloff because those stubborn sons of bitches that hold most the value of the shares intend to DIE with those shares still in their possession.

While those gains were great as random individual gains, the short sellers and market makers were continuing to pull easymoney cash off the top of some average-market-trend number patterns horseshit.

Oh look - the only real position is 200,000 PUTS at 1$. What do these options do when volatility decreases in an environment where volatility is the dominant force? They cause hedge-selling. This is made worse when you look at how the option's deltas are changing with price decreases as well - they are delta hedged also by selling. So on both fronts: decreasing volatility and decreasing price are causing selling. Both of which are occurring. But not in a way that is significant for a downward squeeze - but a slow, menacing squeeze like the time you chaffed your wife's bf.







Is there threat of an upsqueeze? Lol. There are 187,581 calls compared to 905,192 puts. People can't even sell calls it seems - so I would say minimal.

&amp;#x200B;







# The Great RobinHood Ass-Covering 







*(sources listed at bottom for images btw)*







**Pre-cursor Statements:**







* This is sort of a question + hypothetical + little tinfoilery so bear with me regarding RobinHood's ""f*ractional share*"" / ""p*artial stock*"" ownership investing tool (*I'm not sure what they call it*). 



* I'm also under the assumption a lot of you purchased these 'partial shares' in an attempt to get in with the GME move.







**The Hypothetical Rambling:**







So let's [look at how many institutions had stakes in GME](https://i.imgur.com/1DA71UK.png) prior to what will most likely go down in history as the most hilarious HF short-covering shitshow of all time. [Even looking through the alphabetical assortment of institutional ownership](https://i.imgur.com/lIfPwV5.png) I don't see anywhere that Robinhood owned GME prior to the reporting date of 12/31/2020. So how is Robinhood able to sell small partitions of an equity / stock without actually owning it? This questions is bugging me, especially [since they claim these fractional shares are pieces of actual whole shares](https://robinhood.com/us/en/support/articles/fractional-shares/). So if Robinhood is selling these fractional shares... wouldn't they have to initially own the whole share in order to partition this stock into sublet shares to sell on their platform?







Enter the tinfoil hypothetical - **Robinhood never actually bought the GME stock and just sold the partial shares to investors, effectively creating their own uncovered GME position.** You autists purchased so many GME fractional shares that Robinhood's risk assessment team had a stroke. Combined with the GME shares they handed over on margin, the fact multiple major short-positioned HFs were frantically covering their own ass, and how many ""*whole shares*"" were needed for covering all the sold ""*fractional shares*"", RobinHood had created themselves an environment in which they are getting fucked harder than a mollied-up Kimberly Guilfoyle at an RNC convention. Once the realization set in that RobinHood is potentially on the line for 1,000,000s of uncovered GME shares they had to do something.







Welcome to Thursday 01/28/2021 where Robinhood freezes the sales of GME, strips margin accounts of GME positions, and gets their hands dirty in price manipulation based on the fact they had control over a massive GME purchasing power group. My hypothesis is they used this time to cover their own asses and buy their own shares of GME to close out this magnificent fucking failure of their own investing platform. It's completely possible they are even the reason behind the +100% short interest because they were borrowing already short-sold shares from Citron to sell the margin account GME positions and fractional shares.







&amp;#x200B;







**TL;DR** \- Robinhood put themselves in their own short-sold position with GME with fractional shares, possibly margin sales as well, and they halted the GME stock on their platform so they themselves could cover.







This is just speculation and a thought, I'm curious if this holds any weight or could be a realistic situation. What are your thoughts?

# The Great RobinHood Ass-Covering 







*(sources listed at bottom for images btw)*







**Pre-cursor Statements:**







* This is sort of a question + hypothetical + little tinfoilery so bear with me regarding RobinHood's ""f*ractional share*"" / ""p*artial stock*"" ownership investing tool (*I'm not sure what they call it*). 



* I'm also under the assumption a lot of you purchased these 'partial shares' in an attempt to get in with the GME move.







**The Hypothetical Rambling:**







So let's [look at how many institutions had stakes in GME](https://i.imgur.com/1DA71UK.png) prior to what will most likely go down in history as the most hilarious HF short-covering shitshow of all time. [Even looking through the alphabetical assortment of institutional ownership](https://i.imgur.com/lIfPwV5.png) I don't see anywhere that Robinhood owned GME prior to the reporting date of 12/31/2020. So how is Robinhood able to sell small partitions of an equity / stock without actually owning it? This questions is bugging me, especially [since they claim these fractional shares are pieces of actual whole shares](https://robinhood.com/us/en/support/articles/fractional-shares/). So if Robinhood is selling these fractional shares... wouldn't they have to initially own the whole share in order to partition this stock into sublet shares to sell on their platform?
