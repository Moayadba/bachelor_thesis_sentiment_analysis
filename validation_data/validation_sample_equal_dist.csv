66,l6akj3,"$BBBY, $GME<U+0092>s inbred cousin.: Whats up retards. Let me tell you about a company called Bed Bath and Beyond. Yes, the mattress and furniture retailer. Lemme enlighten you with some DD.







1. Short Interest







$BBBY has a short interest of 67%. 67 fucking percent. The hedge funds want this stock dead and buried. GME had a short interest of 142%, hence its rally. 67% is not far off.







2. Market Cap







$BBBY's market cap is $5bn. GME's had a market cap of $9bn just a few days ago. There is tremendous amounts of room for growth and upwards movement. $BBBY<U+0092>s a sleeping giant.







3. PB Ratio







$BBBY's price to book ratio is 3.2. Right now Tesla's is 50 and GME's is 30. This shows clear fucking upside potential and we haven't even gotten started yet. $BBBY's PB ratio is fucking cheap.







4. Financials







$BBBY's net income increased in the last quarter of 2021 and is showing an upward trajectory. Positive fucking financials so you're not investing in some company that's financially bleeding.







5. P/E Ratio







Not even gonna sugarcoat this one. 7.9. 7 point fucking 9. Undervalued and extremely cheap. Tesla's PE Ratio is at 1,685. GME's is currently unavailable cause you retards shot it through the roof but I guarantee it's fucking high.

This is now my fourth attempt to try to post this.



Ok well now that I have your attention I want to point out a few things. 



Disclaimer: not financial advice, and I<U+0092>m long 130 GME shares 







1. There have been a lot of bot accounts here recently that have been pushing everything but GME to try to get you out of your positions and into something else anything else. 







They have been pushing things like AMC Nokia and BB. Ask yourself how much DD you have seen for these? Well the answer is almost zero(except for BB) these are being pumped for the sole focus of getting you out of your GME position. Although BB might be a solid long term play short term GME is still a once in a life time play that isn<U+0092>t close to over. 







2. For all the new people here we aren<U+0092>t short busters, we don<U+0092>t go around looking for high short interest to force shorts to cover. That<U+0092>s not how things work here and it will backfire. I don<U+0092>t know wether it<U+0092>s a result of greed or arrogance but we don<U+0092>t run the markets and we never will. If you try to get in a tug of war with a hedge fund they will kill your positions. Any who has been here longer than a month remembers a time where an MM fucked half the sub at once in the blink of an eye, or when PLTR 30 calls expired worthless.











3  Why is GME different? It<U+0092>s different because GME is a value play first short squeeze second. The price was being suppressed artificially by high short interest. The real value was some where closer to 4x it<U+0092>s 20$ valuation. If GME was actually going to go bankrupt shorts would have waited us out until we lost interest or GME declared bankruptcy. 











4 short interest is still high. Regardless of what the Fake News media is telling you short interest is still high. I imagine a lot of retail shorts have covered at this point or been margin called, but for every short that exits a new one enters its place. These companies are in so deep that they will be forced to cover eventually and when they do it will be violent. Trust me you will know when Melvin liquidates there position. If the price has gone up this much based off of no major shorts covering imagine what will happen when they all cover in a violent exit with everyone trying to leave first. 







5 GME board thinks this is still going up. Remember the 100 million $ share offering originally intended to fend off Cohen? Well that still on the table and they haven<U+0092>t used it yet. Management would try to use it as close to the top as possible to minimize dilution. The fact it has been used yet implies a heavy upside. 







6 why I am still bullish? I am still bullish because of all the Options expiring ITM on Friday and the subsequent Monday after. A large amount of calls will expire on Friday, and market makers will need to have the shares for them if they don<U+0092>t already. There is a strong possibility of a gamma squeeze Friday with people expecting a repeat of last Friday in a positive feedback loop. 







7 There<U+0092>s also the fact that on Monday, there will likely be less float. This is if we see a repeat of of this week where shares were held up in clearing houses until Tuesday. This would leave us with almost no float on Monday making every move more violent and extreme. It would be easier for Melvin and Co to manipulate the price because of this, but it will be unlikely they have the capital left to do so. If a large short position is closed this could be the most parabolic movement of the whole squeeze. This is the day I<U+0092>m most exited for personally. Regardless of all this there is no telling what will happen the rest of the week. If I could see the future I would be a billionaire.

OK degenerates, listen up. I've been doing some research on oil and I'm certain that MRO is STUPIDLY undervalued the same way Gamestop was back in August. Here's my DD:_x000D__x000D__x000D__x000D_
_x000D__x000D__x000D__x000D_
First, MRO's market cap is $6.02 billion, but its net assets are $10.89 billion. This means that MRO should be trading AT LEAST at $14.93. This is why most analysts like Morningstar or raise its evaluation to $11 or $13, but I think they're being too conservative with its valuation. _x000D__x000D__x000D__x000D_
_x000D__x000D__x000D__x000D_
For one, MRO revenue in September increased 177% from the previous quarter while costs were about the same. The price of oil from March to June was about $30 while from June to Sept it stayed around $40. With just a $10 change in the price of oil, MRO was able to more than double its revenue. With oil prices nearing $50 now, it's very likely MRO will post a profit in Q4 2020._x000D__x000D__x000D__x000D_
_x000D__x000D__x000D__x000D_
Once they post a profit, MRO will return back to its true value of $10.89 billion meaning the price will SPIKE to $14.93. IMO the big funds have it WRONG because $11-$13 is undervaluing MRO. Their evaluations also rely on the assumption that MRO will lose money throughout 2021. _x000D__x000D__x000D__x000D_
_x000D__x000D__x000D__x000D_
Idiots will say that oil isn't as hot as renewables, which is true, but oil isn't gonna go away either. Between now and 2030, people still need oil to drive cars. Remember that gas powered cars are still 97.5% of all cars on the road right now. _x000D__x000D__x000D__x000D_

Furthermore, IF Tesla somehow pops, many electric car companies may pop as well and they might switch to gas car or oil companies. This can act as a hedge in the event Tesla pops. _x000D__x000D__x000D__x000D_

OK degenerates, listen up. I've been doing some research on oil and I'm certain that MRO is STUPIDLY undervalued the same way Gamestop was back in August. Here's my DD:_x000D__x000D__x000D__x000D_
_x000D__x000D__x000D__x000D_
First, MRO's market cap is $6.02 billion, but its net assets are $10.89 billion. This means that MRO should be trading AT LEAST at $14.93. This is why most analysts like Morningstar or raise its evaluation to $11 or $13, but I think they're being too conservative with its valuation. _x000D__x000D__x000D__x000D_
_x000D__x000D__x000D__x000D_
For one, MRO revenue in September increased 177% from the previous quarter while costs were about the same. The price of oil from March to June was about $30 while from June to Sept it stayed around $40. With just a $10 change in the price of oil, MRO was able to more than double its revenue. With oil prices nearing $50 now, it's very likely MRO will post a profit in Q4 2020._x000D__x000D__x000D__x000D_
_x000D__x000D__x000D__x000D_
Once they post a profit, MRO will return back to its true value of $10.89 billion meaning the price will SPIKE to $14.93. IMO the big funds have it WRONG because $11-$13 is undervaluing MRO. Their evaluations also rely on the assumption that MRO will lose money throughout 2021. _x000D__x000D__x000D__x000D_

99,m0rpsb,"TIFU by selling GME because of my wife and then...: I made the mistake of telling my wife about GME about a month or so ago.  Told her I put $10k into it and then the bottom dropped out.  She's been asking me for a few weeks about when I'm going to get back to equal.  After a month or so of being negative (at one point 70%), I finally went green on my basis today.  Sold my stock holdings of GME.  Showed my wife that I sold it and even made a little bit of money.  She walked away saying, ""Finally!  Stop buying stupid crap and just invest in normal stuff"".







10 minutes later, I placed another maxed out GME order because I like the stock.   Not easy going un-retarded once you go full retard.","TIFU by selling GME because of my wife and then...: I made the mistake of telling my wife about GME about a month or so ago.
